<span class="smaller">THE DEALER IN ANIMALS.</span></h2>

<p>Several years ago, or, to speak more accurately,
in 1871, Philip Garland, a young man of
not more than seventeen years, succeeded his father
in the business of buying, selling and training wild
animals, making a specialty of those belonging to
the monkey kingdom.</p>

<p>Garland, senior, was well and favorably known
throughout the country by proprietors of museums,
circuses, and collectors generally, and his son found
himself the fortunate possessor of an unblemished
reputation and an extensive establishment, together
with a large capital of ready money, but not a
relative to whom he could turn for relaxation from
the cares of business.</p>

<p>Philip and his father had led lonely lives, so far
as intercourse with other members of the human
family was concerned. As a matter of fact they
were well acquainted with their regular customers;
but these came only in the hours devoted to business,
tarried no longer than was absolutely necessary,
and probably cared not one whit how these
merchants passed their leisure time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>Perhaps this comparative isolation was the cause
of Philip’s devoting himself with such assiduity to
his profession, if such it may be termed. From his
childhood the senior Garland had instilled into his
son’s mind the rudiments of natural history, and
having the rare faculty of so presenting dry subjects
as to make them interesting, he had so thoroughly
enlisted the boy’s attention and sympathies that
when Master Philip found himself at the head of
the establishment he was one of the most enthusiastic
students.</p>

<p>Unlike his father, he was a naturalist in the full
sense of the word, and devoted himself more particularly
to noting the peculiarities and habits of
four-handed mammals, otherwise known as the monkey
tribe.</p>

<p>In two months after the elder Garland died
Philip’s collection was composed principally of apes,
he having so reduced the stock by forced sales that
nearly every other species of animal, as well as the
entire lot of birds, had given way to the tribe in
whose habits he was so deeply interested.</p>

<p>As a matter of course, any variety of the monkey-kind
are more valuable when their talents for imitation
have been developed by the aid of education,
and the new head of the house of Garland &amp; Co.
made a point of instructing his live articles of
merchandise in the most thorough manner.</p>

<p>During every hour of the day, when not engaged
with customers, Philip taught the apes to throw
somersaults, jump through hoops, dance, play the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
tambourine, and a variety of similar accomplishments.
He also had several so highly educated as
to march at the word of command, present arms,
fire a musket, fence, or salute in true military
fashion.</p>

<p>Quite naturally this reduction of stock to a single
and not very rare species of animal caused a corresponding
falling off in the number of customers.
But for this Philip cared little. His bank account
was sufficiently large to admit of his conducting the
business after his own peculiar fashion, regardless of
whether the balance at the end of the year was in
his favor or not; and as the sales were limited so
did his stock increase, until, at the time when an old
friend of his father’s, Captain Seaworth, master of
the good ship Reynard, called in company with his
first and second officers at what was now little more
than a monkey emporium, to give the young man
good advice, he was greatly amused at the proficiency
to which these long-tailed animals had been
brought.</p>

<p>Among the large collection were four which
attracted the most attention; and, as may be supposed,
these were the ones upon whom Philip had
spent the greater portion of his time in teaching.
Two were enormous baboons, strong as giants, and
of corresponding ferocity. When their instruction
was begun they would oftentimes seize the iron rods
which were used in the way of discipline, bending
them like straws; and more than once had their
teacher battled for his life when these pupils escaped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
from the stoutly-barred cage. Finally, however,
both had been partially subdued through fear,
not love, until, with many a grimace and angry
gesture, they would obey in a surly manner the
orders given.</p>

<p>That these brutes knew exactly what their
teacher desired of them was shown even when they
refused to do his bidding. Both were well aware
when the hour for study had come, and from their
movements one would have said they were discussing
the question as to whether it was best to learn
anything on this particular day or hold out against
the master at the expense of a severe flogging.</p>

<p>Philip often said that there was no animal in his
collection who understood the human voice better
than these same ferocious brutes, and their disobedience
was only proof of their vicious natures.</p>

<p>“Those fellows know enough to put me through
the same course of instruction, provided they held
the iron rod and had the opportunity,” Philip often
said to his assistants; and at such remarks the larger
of the baboons actually wrinkled his face into what
was very like a smile, as if thinking of the glorious
time he could have in turning the tables on his not
very gentle teacher.</p>

<p>This interesting couple had not inaptly been
christened Goliah and Magog.</p>

<p>The other notable members of the collection were
quite the opposite, both in disposition and appearance.
They were a male and female chimpanzee,
young, and not absolutely ill-favored, if one should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
compare them with the monkey type of beauty.
Both were tractable, obeyed every command as
readily as the best-behaved children, and regarded
their master with an affection which seemed almost
human.</p>

<p>Philip had named the male Ben Bolt and the
female Sweet Alice, because the regard which each
apparently entertained for the other was quite as
fervent, in their monkey way, as is supposed to have
been that of the lovers mentioned in the song.</p>

<p>These two appeared to be perfectly contented in
the Garland establishment. They were not only
docile, but seemingly delighted at being able to
show their proficiency when Philip taught them
new tricks, and the female in particular obeyed the
slightest word as readily as any human being could
have done. Yet these tractable pupils, who never
needed the discipline of the iron rod, had more than
their share of trouble in the fact that Goliah was
most desperately smitten with Sweet Alice, and
would at every opportunity display this fact in a
very disagreeable manner.</p>

<p>In his own peculiar fashion it could plainly be
seen, even by a casual observer, that this monkey-love
was something terrible in its intensity. Whenever,
as frequently happened, the two favorite animals
were allowed the liberty of the museum, this
huge baboon would give proof of the most violent
rage toward Ben Bolt, and on more than one occasion
had Philip’s iron rod been the only thing which
saved the chimpanzee from Goliah’s hideous jealousy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
He would shake the bars of his cage in an excess of
anger if Ben came near him, and make the most
frantic efforts to seize his rival; but thus far the
lovers had escaped any serious injury.</p>

<p>Captain Seaworth, actuated by a desire to assist
the son of his old friend, decided to purchase, for
his amusement during the long voyage he was about
to undertake, one of the baboons, and to this end
selected Goliah, much to the pleasure of Philip.</p>

<p>His officers, following the example of their commander,
also made overtures for the purchase of
Ben Bolt and Sweet Alice, together with four other
less intelligent but well-mannered apes of the collection.</p>

<p>For some time Philip was undecided whether to
part with the two chimpanzees, whom he looked
upon more as pets than articles of merchandise; but
yielding to persuasion and promises that they should
not only be cared for tenderly, but kept far from
the ill-favored Goliah, he finally consented.</p>

<p>It seemed as if the chimpanzees understood that
they were about to be separated from their kind
master, and in every way by which it is possible for
brutes to show grief they displayed it, until the
animal dealer was forced to leave his establishment
during the transfer.</p>

<p>Of Captain Seaworth’s intended voyage Philip
already knew, as did that portion of the public who
make a practice of reading all the daily newspapers.</p>

<p>Under the auspices of a corporation made up of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
coffee merchants in New York and its vicinity, the
Reynard was bound for one of the many islands of
the Malay Archipelago, there to found a colony for
the purpose of raising coffee on a gigantic scale.
The captain’s orders were to consult with the agents
of the corporation at Batavia, who would make a
selection of some land near Borneo which could be
leased or purchased, there landing the laborers, and
directing their movements until the enterprise
should be well begun. After that, Captain Seaworth
would proceed in accordance with such instructions
as might be received from home.</p>

<p>Thus it was a long voyage that these dumb members
of Philip’s establishment were to take, and it is
little wonder that he feared for the safety of Ben
Bolt and Sweet Alice while on shipboard with the
ferocious and mighty Goliah.</p>

<p>If the young merchant had had the slightest idea
of the wicked cunning in the breast of the huge
baboon, it is safe to say he would never have consented
to sell him to a friend such as Captain Seaworth;
and, also, could he have known how much
suffering this same animal would cause him in the
future, Goliah’s career might have been ended very
suddenly by a pistol-ball. Then the reasons for the
writing of this story could hardly have existed.</p>

<p>“Treat the animals well, but let them know you
are the master,” Philip said to the captain on the
day the latter made his final visit to the establishment.
“They have considerably more intelligence
than is generally credited to them, and I oftentimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
imagine they understand very much of ones conversation.”</p>

<p>Philip really believed that this species of animal
comprehended many words; and it was destined
that his experience in the future, although covering
but a short space of time, should eclipse all he had
thus far learned from books or by observation.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.<br />
<span class="smaller">MAGOG’S REVENGE.</span></h2>

<p>Within an hour from the time Captain Seaworth
and his officers had taken their purchases
to the ship, it was apparent to every employe
of Garland &amp; Co.’s establishment that the
baboon, Magog, was in a towering rage.</p>

<p>Had he been able to speak he could not have indicated
more plainly his anger at being thus separated
from his old companion; and after that time
it was dangerous for either Philip or the attendants
to approach within reach of the cage.</p>

<p>His fury increased with time, until the most venturesome
of museum proprietors would have hesitated
to receive the huge brute as a gift, for a
wounded tiger could not have been more intractable.</p>

<p>Many times before six months had elapsed did
Philip contemplate killing the ferocious captive; but
on every occasion when he had almost decided so to
do, the hope that he might succeed in taming him
prevented the commission of the deed.</p>

<p>It was seven months from the day the Reynard left
port when Philip made his last attempt at subduing
Magog. On this afternoon he allowed the ferocious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
ape to come out into the exercise-hall of the animals’
quarters, and before the lesson was well begun a
number of old customers arrived, causing the merchant
to return the captive hurriedly to his cage. In
his desire to make haste the usual precautions were
neglected, and Magog’s eyes twinkled with satisfaction
as he noted the insecure fastenings of his
prison.</p>

<p>During the remainder of that day he was unusually
quiet, and the keepers wondered not a little as
to the cause of his remarkable docility, for there
was hardly an hour since Goliah had been taken
away during which he did not make the most frantic
efforts to escape.</p>

<p>When Philip conducted his customers through this
particular portion of the establishment Magog was
sitting contentedly in one corner of his cage, and
the merchant said, in a tone of pride:</p>

<p>“There is a baboon that has given me more
trouble than all the rest of the collection; but I am
fast subduing him, and soon we shall have no more
tractable performer than he. Three months from
now I will show you this fellow transformed into
the most agile and willing acrobat.”</p>

<p>Again Magog’s eyes twinkled, as if he understood
the remark and was content to bide his time until
the plan of revenge which, perhaps, had been maturing
in his mind so long, should be ready for execution.</p>

<p>The wily ape had not long to wait. On that very
night, when the attendants vacated the large hall,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
which was lined on every side with cages, they left
one gas-jet burning, according to custom, and firmly
barred the door on the outside. This was the opportunity
Magog desired.</p>

<p>The bolt of his cage was so insecurely fastened
as to be very easily slipped back; and as if he understood
that the slightest unusual sound might
betray his purpose, he stole softly into the hall,
looked about him in every direction until satisfied
he was the only one free, and then turned on the
gas, as he had often seen Philip’s employes do.</p>

<p>A wisp of straw from his own cage served the
same purpose as a torch such as was generally used
for lighting the other jets, and in a few moments he
had the place brilliantly illuminated, but not in such
a thorough manner as satisfied him.</p>

<p>More straw was at hand. He pulled armfuls
from every cage, heaping it high, until his own was
nearly filled, and then, with a savage cry of what
might well have been mistaken for pleasure, applied
the torch to this inflammable material.</p>

<p>In a few moments the entire room was in flames,
and the vengeful baboon, leaping from one point to
another regardless of his own injuries, was scattering
fire here and there, until any effort at saving
Garland &amp; Co.’s establishment would have been useless.</p>

<p>When the morning sun arose Philip found himself
without employment. All of the monkey tribe
upon whom he had devoted so much time and attention
were now as thoroughly roasted as any African<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
epicure could have desired; and among these possibly
savory bodies reposed that of Magog, whose revenge
had culminated in his own death.</p>

<p>Philip was still young. He had plenty of money
at his command, and there was but one desire in his
heart, viz.: to rebuild and restock an animal emporium
which should far excel the one destroyed.</p>

<p>But this could not be done by remaining in New
York.</p>

<p>Thus far he had been the largest dealer in animals
in the country, and the combined stock of all the
others put together would not have sufficed to form
such a collection as the one just burned; therefore
it was necessary he should search among the jungles
and in the forests for the various specimens of that
tribe toward whom all his studies had been directed.</p>

<p>When one has almost unlimited means at his command,
to desire is to accomplish, providing energy
is not wanting, and Philip Garland lost no time in
carrying out what had now become his sole aim in
life.</p>

<p>The bark Swallow, four hundred tons burden, was
advertised for charter, and with her owners the
young merchant made a bargain for the exclusive
use of the craft during a period of three years.</p>

<p>Then came the labor of preparing cages, putting
in stores, fitting the hold for the reception of the
strange passengers whom it was proposed to bring
back, and otherwise making the many arrangements
necessary for such a cruise.</p>

<p>In due course of time all this was performed, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
eight months from the day the Reynard left port
with the choicest portion of Garland &amp; Co.’s collection
on board the Swallow was towed down to
Sandy Hook. From there, spreading her white
wings, she sped away toward the Malay Archipelago,
from whence she was to proceed, in case a
sufficient number of animals and birds were not
procured there, to the southernmost point of Africa,
on her return home.</p>

<p>Of the voyage out it is hardly necessary to speak.
The first stop was at the Ascension Islands for
water, and then, passing on within sight of St.
Helena, they made the Cape of Good Hope.</p>

<p>It had not been Philip’s intention to take on any
animals at this point until his return; but the agent
of a Hamburg firm had just come down to the coast
with a rare lot, which he offered at prices so exceedingly
low as to make it an object to keep them on
shipboard during the entire voyage.</p>

<p>The collection was made up of a black two-horned
rhinoceros, three lions, two panthers, and three serpents.</p>

<p>The agent had expected to find the firm’s ship in
port; but through some misunderstanding or disaster
she was not there, and it became necessary for
him to dispose of the stock at any price rather than
remain an indefinite length of time for the vessel,
which might never come.</p>

<p>Philip soon effected a trade upon such a basis that
if he should save either of the animals until his return
home the venture would be a paying one, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
the transfer of these unwilling and unwieldy passengers
was at once begun.</p>

<p>The rhinoceros was confined in a pen of wood
and iron just abaft the foremast, where he had very
little room to spare, and immediately after coming
on board the huge brute appeared as docile and contented
as could have been desired.</p>

<p>In fact, the entire collection had been brought
from the shore without the slightest difficulty, and
after a stay of only two days the Swallow set sail,
making an offing about sunset.</p>

<p>When darkness settled down over the waste of
waters the new passengers began to make their
presence known, and from that time until morning
no one on board could have entertained the slightest
doubt as to the nature of this partial cargo, for the
howls, roars, yelps and screams would have drowned
the shrieking of the wildest tempest.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.<br />
<span class="smaller">A TERRIBLE NIGHT.</span></h2>

<p>With the setting of the sun the wind came in
fitful gusts, betokening a storm, if not a hurricane.</p>

<p>During the first few hours of darkness the rhinoceros
did not join in the concert begun by the
other animals; but as the wind increased in violence,
and the sea became more choppy, causing the bark
to reel and stagger under the heavy blows, the deck-passengers
became decidedly uneasy. When the
lions were not roaring, or the panthers screaming,
the thick-skinned captive would utter a loud “woof,”
and make such an attack on his cage that the watch
on deck were ready to leap into the rigging at the
first sign that he was succeeding in his efforts.</p>

<p>Each animal had been captured singly, and all
were full-grown and dangerous. The near presence
of the men, the sight of each other, and the violent
motions of the bark, alarmed every one. Even the
serpents were wide awake and vengeful; but the
rhinoceros was furious with rage. He raked his
great horn back and forth across the bars of the pen
whenever any one went near him, and in a dozen
ways gave evidence of his strength.</p>

<p>Most probably the unusual motion made every member<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
of the collection seasick, and as the malady increased
so did their rage. Philip knew that during
the first forty-eight hours the danger would be greatest,
and he kept a watchful eye upon the noisy passengers.
After they had gotten their “sea-legs” on, as
sailors express it, there would be no more possibility
of trouble than under the same circumstances
ashore, and to get them safely through this period of
probation was now his only care.</p>

<p>About a quarter of an hour before midnight,
when all the watch on deck save the man at the
wheel were forward, the rhinoceros leaned heavily
against the side of his cage just as the bark buried
her bow in a green wave, which, curling over the
forecastle, swept every movable thing aft. Immediately
following this came a great crash, startling
the already frightened crew.</p>

<p>The mighty plunge of the vessel, together with
the weight of the animal on the bars of the cage,
had crushed them like pipe-stems, and the huge
monster emerged from the ruins fully prepared for
mischief.</p>

<p>A more dangerous and vindictive creature than a
black rhinoceros cannot be found. He is in the
sulks nearly all the time, and while under such influence
or humor will charge an elephant or a lion
without fear of the result. The first thing which
comes in sight is attacked, and he never cools down
so long as there is anything on which to wreak his
vengeance.</p>

<p>It was as if the tossing of the vessel served to excite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
his anger still more, and he made desperate
lunges here and there at the nearest inanimate objects,
sometimes being thrown from his feet as the
bark rose or fell; and, again, splintering into fragments
such lighter articles as the hen-coops, the captain’s
gig, which was stowed on deck, and the crates
containing fresh vegetables taken on board at Cape
Town.</p>

<p>At the first intimation of this danger, which was
more imminent than the threatening elements, the
sailors leaped into the rigging, and for ten minutes
the monster had the deck nearly to himself.</p>

<p>After having fallen several times the old fellow
looked about, as if studying how he could soonest
recover his sea-legs, and when that brief time of
apparent thoughtfulness had passed he was as
steady as a sailor. The rise and fall of the bark,
abrupt and sharp as it was, caused him to slide to
and fro, but he never lost his equilibrium.</p>

<p>After thus regaining control of his unwieldy
body, the first thing which attracted his attention
was the cage containing the serpents. With one
mighty rush he tossed it in the air, and as it came
down the three hissing occupants glided in different
directions, one climbing over the cage containing
the panthers, the second going on to the bowsprit,
and the third darting into the forecastle out of
sight.</p>

<p>The lions and panthers immediately raised a terrible
din, which, with the roaring of the gale, made
the confusion most deafening. The big beast cleared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
his horn of the fragments of the cage hanging to it,
and then struck that containing the panther.</p>

<p>These animals were liberated in an instant. One
ran aft into the long-boat, which hung on the davits,
crouching under the thwarts; and the other, cowed
for the moment, but ready for mischief, retreated to
the lee-scuppers.</p>

<p>Without so much as glancing at the panthers, the
rhinoceros dashed at the pen of the lions, smashing
it into kindlings.</p>

<p>The largest of the three captives sprang upon his
adversary’s back as he shook himself free from
the fragments, and perhaps his sharp claws inflicted
some injury, but not enough to check the fury of
the beast, who chased the second one aft to the
quarter-deck.</p>

<p>The third lion disappeared in the forecastle; and
never was a watch below awakened more quickly or
more thoroughly than were those who came tumbling
up, half-dressed, terrified, and not knowing in
which direction safety might be found.</p>

<p>No ship’s crew ever were in a stranger situation.
It was high time sail should be shortened, the mate
in charge having delayed this work until both
watches should be on deck; and with these enraged
animals virtually in possession, the bravest sailor
would hardly have dared to leave the rigging.</p>

<p>The helmsman remained at his post of duty despite
the fact that the panther was in the long-boat
behind him, and it was his shrieks that called Philip,
the captain and second officer from the cabin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>Hardly did they emerge from the companion-way
when the lion which had attacked the rhinoceros
came bounding aft, and the three men fled below
again, the helmsman following them and closing the
hatch behind him.</p>

<p>To leave this place of refuge immediately meant
death, while by remaining in it destruction seemed
equally certain. Yet, strange to say, the gallant
vessel sped before the wind as if a steady hand
guided her movements; and five minutes later,
Philip, accustomed from infancy to such animals,
had burst his way out through the deck-window of
the cabin.</p>

<p>As a matter of course there were plenty of
heavy guns and ammunition on board; and with a
Manton rifle and explosive shells, he sheltered himself
behind the foremast, where he immediately
opened fire on the nearest brute.</p>

<p>While he was making every effort to draw the
rhinoceros toward him, in order to get a fairer
mark, the lion on the quarter-deck leaped into the
long-boat upon the panther. In the merest fraction
of time the two were bounding over the thwarts
and tumbling about in the wildest fashion, the boat
rocking to and fro as if it would upset, the screams
and roars of the struggling beasts drowning all the
other horrible noises.</p>

<p>This fight attracted the attention of the rhinoceros,
causing him, despite Philip’s endeavors, to
make his way aft, where he came across the lion
who was skulking in the scuppers. To drive the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
king of beasts back toward the wheel was not difficult
for the huge monster, who was now so blinded
by rage that he made a direct dash at the cabin-door.</p>

<p>No wood ever grew that could withstand such
an assault, and as the rhinoceros forced his way
into the saloon the captain and second mate took
refuge in the steward’s pantry, where they were even
closer prisoners than before.</p>

<p>Straight on the charge was continued!</p>

<p>The dining-table was overturned, the chairs swept
from their fastenings like so many things of straw,
and as the after-end of the cabin was reached the
bark rose to a huge wave. As a matter of course
this gave an additional impetus to the enormous animal,
and with a crash he plunged directly through
the bulk-head, which formed what might be termed
a deck-lazaret, where he was held fast by the heavy
timbers despite his furious struggles. This gave
the imprisoned ones in the pantry an opportunity to
escape, and they reached the deck just as Philip,
running to the wheel, opened fire on the animals in
the boat.</p>

<p>One discharge of the weapon point-blank at the
beasts, who had grappled and were rearing up from
the thwarts, together with the rocking of the frail
craft, caused the combatants to topple over the rail,
and two of the disagreeable passengers were
stricken from the list.</p>

<p>At this moment one of the crew shouted that a
panther, a lion and two of the serpents were in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
forecastle; and for the captain and second officer to
imprison them by closing the hatch was but the
work of a moment.</p>

<p>That the rhinoceros could do little or no damage
while in his present position Philip understood from
what he had been told, and he turned his attention
to the remaining lion, crouching near the water-butt,
while the carpenter attacked the snake, who was
making his way up the mainmast.</p>

<p>This last passenger was disposed of in short order,
but not until he had been chopped into many pieces;
and during such carving Philip succeeded in implanting
a lucky shot directly in the heart of the lion,
which effectually ended this portion of the struggle.</p>

<p>The crew paid no further attention to the other
animals, but bent all their energies to saving the
gallant craft which had, unattended, borne them on
so bravely in the face of the gale. With nearly
every member of both watches in the rigging the
work of shortening sail was quickly performed; and,
as the bark rode more easily over the mountainous
seas, Philip and the captain went below to still the
struggle of their unwieldy cabin passenger.</p>

<p>It required a dozen shots from the heavy rifle before
the huge and helpless brute gave up his life.
The work of removing the body could not be attended
to during the hours of darkness, neither was
it deemed advisable to make any effort at cleaning
the forecastle. It would be “all hands on deck”
till morning; but that was a minor consideration in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
view of the fact that they had escaped so many dangers.</p>

<p>After barricading the forecastle hatch with chain-cables
and other heavy articles which would resist
any pressure from within, the crew spent the remainder
of the night listening to the sounds of conflict.
They could hear the hiss of the serpents, the
screams of the panther, and the growling of the
lion until nearly morning, when all became silent.
The animals were either dead or had concluded to
suspend hostilities for awhile.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>




<h2 id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE WRECK.</span></h2>

<p>With the rising sun the wind abated, and
when it was sufficiently light all hands set
about the task of cleaning ship.</p>

<p>To remove the huge animal from the cabin it was
necessary to literally chop him in such pieces as
could be readily handled, and two hours elapsed before
the last fragment had been thrown overboard
to the following sharks.</p>

<p>Then all hands, save the man at the wheel, armed
with cutlasses, rifles and capstan-bars, gathered
around the forecastle hatch as it was pushed back.</p>

<p>A terrible stench arose, but no sound was heard.
After five minutes Philip descended the ladder with
a revolver in each hand; but no enemy confronted
him. There had been a general battle, during which
the beasts were mangled and torn in the most horrible
manner, while the serpents were literally cut
in pieces.</p>

<p>Not until twenty-four hours had passed was the
bark free from odor, blood, and other evidences of
the conflict; and during the week which followed
the carpenter and his assistants had quite as much
as they could do to repair the injury done the cabin.</p>

<p>Philip’s venture had not proven a paying one; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
in view of what might have happened he was only
too well pleased to be rid of his dangerous merchandise.
As he thought of this, the first speculation since
Magog destroyed the establishment, and reflected
upon the result of it, there came into his mind a
fear that it might be the beginning of a series of
misfortunes.</p>

<p>Of course such superstitious fears were more than
childish, and he struggled manfully but unsuccessfully
to put them far from him.</p>

<p>That which had just occurred, however, was but
a foretaste of what might be expected when there
was a full cargo of animals on board; and in the
forecastle the sailors discussed the possible fate of
all hands during the homeward voyage.</p>

<p>“I’ve been in ships what was becalmed week in
an’ week out for two months, with never a cat to
throw overboard,” old Tom Bixbee said, as the watch
below were reviewing the events of the past few
hours, “but I never struck on anything like this
craft. Talk of havin’ a drownded man as shipmate!
Why, that’s nothin’ compared to what’s goin’ to
happen on this’ ere barkey when she turns her nose
toward home. If there’s ever a chance of showin’
my heels to the Swallow in this ’ere benighted place
we’re bound for after more jest like sich as we had
last night, you’ll see precious little of me!”</p>

<p>And Tom’s opinion was very much the same as
that entertained by every member of the crew.</p>

<p>As the bark continued on with favoring winds
through the Indian Ocean, never a day passed but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
that some one of the sailors had a particularly harrowing
tale to tell of ghost-infested ships, and the
conclusion to each would invariably be:</p>

<p>“But they couldn’t hold a candle to a craft like
this what’s goin’ to take on board sich a crowd as
we left Cape Town with.”</p>

<p>Sailors on a long voyage have plenty of opportunity
for strengthening their strong belief in the
supernatural, and in this case the reasons for misgivings
were so real that it is little wonder all hands,
from the boatswain to the cook, were in a state very
nearly bordering on insubordination when the
Swallow entered the Straits of Sunda, bearing to the
westward on a course to the Celebes.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was because of this mutinous condition
of the men that the bark was not kept true to the
needle, or, again, it may have been that the captain
was at fault in his navigation. At all events, on the
morning of the fourth day after leaving the straits,
while sailing over a mirror-like sea and under cloudless
skies, the Swallow brought up with a terrific
crash against a sunken reef.</p>

<p>In an instant all was confusion. Orders were not
obeyed as promptly as should have been the case,
because the sailors had settled in their minds that
this was an incident to be expected during such a
cruise, and for several moments the bark pounded
and thumped upon the rock until, without the aid
of her crew, she slipped off into deep water again.</p>

<p>As a matter of course, the first thing after this
hidden danger had apparently been passed in safety<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
was to sound the well, and to the dismay of Philip,
if not of the insubordinate crew, it was learned that
the bark was leaking.</p>

<p>The damage done was something even more
serious than the starting of a timber, as could be
told from the fact that in half an hour the depth of
water in the hold had increased from four to nine
inches.</p>

<p>At that rate it was only a question of a few hours
before the vessel would founder; but it was possible
the injury might be so far repaired as to admit of
her reaching some island on which she could be
beached, and the men were stationed at the pumps
while the carpenter and first mate went into the
hold.</p>

<p>Tom Bixbee boldly announced that in his opinion
the best thing they could do would be to “save their
own precious selves, an’ leave the old barkey to sink
if she wanted to;” and this advice might possibly
have been followed, owing to the frame of mind in
which the crew were, if the officers and Philip had
not assumed such a determined front.</p>

<p>Almost at the point of revolvers were the men
forced to labor at the pumps; and as if this disaster
was not enough to dishearten Philip, the elements
began to play their part in wrecking the craft
which had come so far for such a strange cargo.</p>

<p>In two hours the breeze from the south had increased
to a gale. The sea suddenly rose very high,
and with all the light canvas stowed, the sinking
vessel was headed toward the coast of Borneo under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
storm-sails only. There was little hope in the minds
of the most sanguine that she could float much
longer; but yet the only chance of safety was in
making land.</p>

<p>Some time previous the carpenter had made his
report privately to the captain; but the crew understood
very well from the expression of his face how
imminent was the danger which threatened.</p>

<p>The damage was so near the keel that it could not
be gotten at without removing the ballast, a task
which was impossible of execution owing to the
rapidity with which the bark was settling.</p>

<p>“She would be at the bottom before we could so
much as come at the leak,” the first mate said; and
it was owing to his report that the Swallow had
been headed for the coast.</p>

<p>The wind increased hourly, and in addition to the
water which came through the shattered hull, large
quantities were taken over the rail.</p>

<p>About three o’clock in the afternoon a heavy sea
washed away the port bulwarks fore and aft, completely
flooding the decks, forecastle and cabin.
The port quarter-boat was crushed like an egg-shell,
leaving a few splintered fragments hanging in the
davits, swinging to and fro in what the crew fancied
was an ominously suggestive manner.</p>

<p>Then the sailors mutinied in downright earnest.
With Tom Bixbee as the spokesman they declared
it was useless labor to attempt to sail what was
hardly more than a wreck, and that their lives were
imperiled by remaining longer on board.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>“The only chance we’ve got of saving a single
soul is by sticking to the bark!” the captain shouted.
“We are hardly fifty miles from the coast, and she
can be kept afloat long enough to make that distance
with this wind.”</p>

<p>Again by a liberal display of weapons the men
were forced to return to the pumps; but at sunset
the water had gained upon them so steadily that the
doomed craft began to settle and roll heavily in the
cross-seas.</p>

<p>At this moment, when even the captain was disheartened,
the starboard pump choked, and with
only the port one serviceable it was no longer
reasonable to think of keeping her afloat.</p>

<p>As the captain and Philip, both of whom had
been on deck continuously since the hidden reef was
struck, turned to go into the cabin for the purpose
of saving such valuables as could readily be taken
away, the men became like demons.</p>

<p>There were only two serviceable boats remaining
since the gig had been destroyed by the rhinoceros
and the port quarter-boat carried away in the wreck
of the bulwarks, therefore the possibilities of taking
off the entire crew seemed limited.</p>

<p>Fully aware of this fact, the men took advantage
of the captain’s temporary absence to abandon the
ship, without regard to supplies of food and water,
and despite the threats of the other officers.</p>

<p>The long-boat was stove in the launching, owing
to the absence of discipline, and the starboard quarter-boat
nearly swamped as she was dropped heavily
by the unreasoning men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>When the captain came on deck the crew had
taken to the boat, already half-filled with water,
and were some distance from the sinking bark.</p>

<p>It would have been useless to force them to return,
even if such a thing was possible, for the little
craft could not approach the foundering bark in the
teeth of the gale without being stove to pieces, and
the four officers and Philip stood gazing at the rapidly
retreating boat with despair written on every
feature of their countenances.</p>

<p>This was the culmination of disasters, and from it
there appeared to be no way of escape.</p>

<p>They could do but little toward providing for
their own safety. It was simply a question of
whether the wreck would float until some friendly
craft could be sighted; and this was answered within
two hours from the time the crew abandoned
her.</p>

<p>While the five despairing men were busily engaged
constructing a raft of such materials as could
be hastily gathered from the wave-swept deck, the
Swallow gave a mighty lurch to port; then rising
on her stern-post, as if endeavoring to escape from
the doom which was now so close at hand, she settled
to starboard with such rapidity that those on
board had not even time to throw over the timbers
they had partially lashed together.</p>

<p>Fortunately, so far as Philip Garland was concerned,
he had been hurled beyond the whirlpool
caused by the foundering vessel, and as he struck
out, instinctively rather than because of hope, his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
hands came in contact with the fragments of the
quarter-boat.</p>

<p>Dazed by the shock and blinded with the driving
spray, he grasped with the clutch of a dying man
the frail timbers, and heeded not the black clouds
which opened to belch forth fire and peals of thunder.</p>

<p>The shrieking wind tossed the wreckage upon the
angry, white-crested waves which gleamed like the
fangs of some devouring monster, and the rain descended
in torrents.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>




<h2 id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.<br />
<span class="smaller">ASHORE.</span></h2>

<p>When Philip Garland again fully realized his
situation he could hear, above the roar of
distant thunder, a continuous rumbling noise. Although
never having traveled on the sea very much,
he understood that this dull booming was caused by
the surf, and he thought that the supreme moment
had come.</p>

<p>Then he heard a deafening crash, from what cause
he knew not. It was as if a violent blow had been
delivered full upon his head, and consciousness again
deserted him.</p>

<p>On opening his eyes it seemed as though he had
been awakened from a profound sleep. The sun
beamed down from a blue, cloudless sky. He raised
himself and saw the ocean at his feet, but it was as
placid as a lake.</p>

<p>He was lying on the wet beach, hardly three feet
from where the waves were rippling over the sand
with a musical murmur, which afforded a vivid contrast
to their wild shrieking of the previous night.</p>

<p>Looking around on every hand, not a vessel, boat
or human face was to be seen. He was alone, so far
as could be told from his limited range of vision,
upon an uninhabited island.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>The ill-fortune which began with the destruction
of his establishment by Magog had surely spent
itself in thus throwing him upon this tiny speck of
land on the vast ocean, where, if any one should
come, it would most likely be those more implacable
than the elements.</p>

<p>Philip knew, through books and from conversations
with the captain of the Swallow, that since
passing through the Straits of Sunda they were in
the immediate vicinity of pirates from Sooloo or
Magindinao.</p>

<p>Even the less warlike natives of the Archipelago
were to be feared, for he remembered at this moment
better than ever before the writings of an old
traveler, who says:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The inhabitants of these islands exceed every
other people in cruelty. They regard killing a man
as a mere jest; nor is there any punishment allotted
for such a deed. If any one purchases a new sword
and wishes to try it, he will thrust it into the breast
of the first person he meets. The passers-by examine
the wound, and praise the skill of him who inflicted
it if he thrust in the weapon direct.</p></div>

<p>In this particular portion of the sea, where Philip
had every reason to suppose he was, the pirates
have literally paralyzed trading on the water.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Every year these scourges of the Archipelago
wander in one direction or another, rendezvousing on
some uninhabited island, carrying devastation to all
the small settlements around, robbing, destroying, or
taking captive every one they meet. Their long,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
well-manned proas escape from the pursuit of sailing
vessels by pulling away right in the wind’s-eye;
and the warning smoke of a steamer generally enables
them to hide in some shallow bay, narrow
river, or forest-covered inlet until the danger is
past.</p></div>

<p>Even while the Swallow was at Batavia information
had been received from Banda to the effect
that the pirates were in the vicinity with a fleet of
fifteen proas, attacking and destroying the villages,
and carrying away women and children as slaves.
Men they seldom or never hold as prisoners. The
thrust of a knife or a blow on the head with the
butt of a musket serves to rid them of a troublesome
captive.</p>

<p>Two days before the wreck the Swallow spoke a
proa which had been attacked forty-eight hours
previous. Three of the crew escaped in their small-boat
and hid in the jungle of a neighboring island,
while the pirates killed the remainder and plundered
the vessel.</p>

<p>These men reported the force as numbering sixteen
large war-boats, and the only blow struck by
the traders in their own defence was when the fleet
set sail, leaving a prize-crew of three on the dismantled
proa. The captain, driven to desperation
by his loss, swam off from the shore armed only
with his parang, or long knife, and coming upon
them unawares made a furious attack, killing one
and wounding the others mortally.</p>

<p>Knowing all this, it is not to be wondered at that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
Philip was filled with dismay on finding himself
alone upon an inhospitable shore.</p>

<p>One does not willingly submit to the embrace of
death, however, and before resigning himself to
what now seemed the inevitable he resolved to
make a last effort for life.</p>

<p>With this purpose in view he started toward the
interior, but after traveling a few moments his legs
refused to obey his will.</p>

<p>The exhaustion caused by the previous night’s
exposure and the intense heat so far prostrated him
that he fell half-fainting at the foot of a palm-tree,
whose cool and refreshing shade served to revive
him so far that in a short time he closed his eyes.</p>

<p>When he awoke the sun was low in the heavens.
He must have slept fully eight hours.</p>

<p>His limbs were yet weary, and his eyes heavy
from the profound sleep. In order to dissipate the
lethargy which hung over him he arose to his feet,
walking rapidly forward.</p>

<p>Suddenly from the thicket directly in front of him
he heard what sounded very like a human voice crying
“Wawk, wawk, wawk!”</p>

<p>This was so nearly a command in his own language
that Philip ran forward eagerly, fancying for
the moment that he was about to see a white man,
when the whirring of wings and a quick passage of
gorgeous plumage against the dark green foliage
told he had made the acquaintance for the first time
of a great Bird-of-Paradise, which is to be found
only in this portion of the world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>It was a large male, radiant in all the brilliant
plumage which renders its skin such a valuable
article of merchandise. The wings and tail were of
a rich dark brown, the breast a deep violet, and the
head and neck of a delicate yellow, the feathers
being so short and close set as to resemble velvet.
The lower part of the eyes was a vivid green, while
the back and feet were pale blue.</p>

<p>The two middle feathers of the tail were what
gave a striking appearance to this winged beauty.
They were nearly a yard long, the extreme ends
curving into a complete circle.</p>

<p>Never before had Philip seen even the skin of one
of these rare birds, and forgetting all his troubles,
he watched its flight in mute admiration.</p>

<p>It was to be his good fortune, while in this
wretched condition of both body and mind, to see
what few except the natives of the Archipelago
have ever had the pleasure of witnessing-a party
of feathered dancers all clad in the same gorgeous
plumage as the one he had just startled.</p>

<p>Pushing forward softly among the foliage to catch
one more glimpse of those curling orange feathers,
he saw a dozen or twenty full-plumaged males on a
stout limb, raising and dropping their wings,
stretching their necks, and vibrating their delicately-tinted
coats as if really engaged in some species of
terpsichorean festivities, while now and then they
darted from branch to branch until it appeared that
the entire tree was filled with waving plumes.</p>

<p>It is at such a time as this that the bird-hunter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
secures his richest prizes, and with comparative
ease.</p>

<p>When the Malays find a tree which the birds have
fixed upon as their dancing-place, a little shelter of
palm leaves is built near the trunk among the
branches, and in it before daylight the hunter hides
himself, armed with a bow and several arrows which
terminate in a rough knob. At the foot of the tree
another hunter is concealed. When the dance has
begun the native above shoots his blunt arrow with
such force as to stun the bird, who is secured and
killed by the one on the ground without its plumage
being injured by a drop of blood. The others pay
no attention to this sudden disappearance of their
companion, and the slaughter is continued until the
greater number of the birds are slain.</p>

<p>Philip gazed at this rare and beautiful sight nearly
a quarter of an hour, and then, as if suddenly remembering
his own necessities, he pushed forward
once more among the matted and tangled underbrush.</p>

<p>Before twenty yards had been traversed the
glimpse of a moving object among the trees caused
him to utter a cry of joy. He had seen that which
bore close resemblance to a human form, and quite
naturally he believed it to be some inhabitant of the
island.</p>

<p>Running at full speed, urged to put forth every
effort by the belief that he would soon find aid,
food and shelter, no inconsiderable distance was traversed
during the next ten minutes. To his most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
intense surprise, however, he failed to see again this
figure which had so raised hope, or even to discover
in what direction it fled.</p>

<p>Disheartened, and fancying his eyes had deceived
him, he continued to make his way forward; but
not with the same energy as before. He became
like one who toils without hope of a happy conclusion
to the labor.</p>

<p>Courage revived again however when, on emerging
from the thicket of palms through which he had
been making his way to a more open portion of the
forest, the same figure stood revealed to view.</p>

<p>Philip now watched with the utmost attention,
and was surprised at the wonderful celerity of the
stranger’s movements. He disappeared and then
appeared again, passing from one point to another
much more rapidly than any person could have run,
and in many ways gave such evidence of fear that
the shipwrecked young man advanced yet more
boldly.</p>

<p>Upon arriving at the place where the supposed
native had last been seen, Philip was startled, almost
frightened, as the object of his search suddenly
descended from the top of a tree at his very
feet.</p>

<p>It was an ape!</p>

<p>With one bound the animal mounted the tree
again, then leaped down, and finally placed himself
immediately in Philip’s path, as if to prevent him
from proceeding.</p>

<p>One trained as Philip Garland had been could feel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
but little fear of such an animal. He broke a
branch from the nearest tree, and raising it with a
threatening gesture stepped forward.</p>

<p>This movement aroused the animal to anger. He
retreated a few steps, uttering loud, shrill cries,
which were evidently intended as signals to his companions
in the vicinity; and, as a result, troop upon
troop of apes came from every side through the
openings in the forest. They were of all colors and
sizes, and clambered up the trees, ran along the
branches like squirrels, or, taking a stand about the
stranger, threatened him with their glances and
gestures as they uttered hissing cries, or gnashed
their teeth with such a deafening noise that the
traveler grew positively bewildered.</p>

<p>Better than any one else did Philip understand
the vicious nature of these animals when gathered
in such numbers, and he knew full well that to save
his life retreat was necessary.</p>

<p>This thought came too late, however. On every
side were closely-packed ranks of apes, some of
whom appeared to be as strong as gorillas, and the
first movement toward escape might be the signal
for his death.</p>

<p>Philip had in his pocket a small revolver, placed
there during the mutiny on the Swallow; but of
what avail would it be to kill five of his adversaries
when they could be numbered by hundreds, and had
hemmed him in so closely?</p>

<p>An attempt at flight would be as foolhardy as any
effort toward intimidation. The only course which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
could be pursued with the slightest chance of success
was to remain silent and motionless.</p>

<p>With one hand inside the breast of his coat,
clutching the weapon he was resolved to use only
when death seemed inevitable, he stood immovable
as the animals crowded nearer.</p>

<p>At this juncture the outer circle of apes began to
chatter, as if they were discussing some new aspect
of the affair which had presented itself, and a moment
later the entire party suddenly began to leap
to and fro, making the most hostile demonstrations.</p>

<p>The branch which Philip had broken from the
tree was lying on the ground directly at his feet,
and with a quick movement one of the animals
seized it. Before he had time to place himself in a
position of defense, or even to draw his weapon, the
ape showered blow after blow on his arms, legs, face
and head in such rapid succession that he could not
avoid them.</p>

<p>It was difficult to remain passive under such a
castigation, and also very humiliating, for one whose
business had been the training of monkeys, to receive
punishment from members of the same tribe
he had so often flogged; but under the circumstances
there was no alternative.</p>

<p>At the first blow the apes gave way, much as a
party of men might who form a ring for two pugilists,
and from their points of vantage evinced the
most profound delight. A crowd of boys could
hardly have shown more pleasure at the flogging of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
some obnoxious pedagogue and Philip’s anger almost
blinded his prudence.</p>

<p>During fully ten minutes the punishment, was continued
without intermission, and it might have resulted
fatally to the unfortunate animal-trader if he
had not bethought himself of past experiences, when
he was master and apes were forced to receive his
blows.</p>

<p>Around his neck he wore a blue silk handkerchief
after the fashion of sailors, and this he untied
quickly, throwing it among the crowd of spectators,
knowing full well that any bright color will attract
apes more readily than food or noise.</p>

<p>In an instant the decorous assemblage had resolved
themselves into a shrieking, howling mob.
They rushed toward the one who had been so fortunate
as to secure the prize, each trying in turn to
seize it, chattering and screaming until the din was
absolutely deafening. He who had played the part
of castigator followed the example of the others,
and from a friendly contest it soon became a veritable
fight, during which there was but little question
that the object of their desires would be torn
into shreds.</p>

<p>This was Philip’s opportunity. Not one of the
combatants was paying the slightest attention to
him, and after stealing softly through the foliage
until the apes were shut out from view, he ran toward
the interior of the island at full speed.</p>

<p>It must not be supposed that Philip’s flight
through the thicket was attended with no more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
inconvenience than would be the case in an American
forest. Almost every shrub and tree was infested
with small black ants, and as the fugitive brushed
past they loosened their hold on the foliage to literally
take possession of his body.</p>

<p>Before running a hundred yards his face and neck
were covered, and he could feel them on every inch
of his skin, as they bit with a sharpness which
seemed like the prick of a huge needle.</p>

<p>In addition to these pests, which were very painful,
there was a species of blue-bottle fly, so numerous
that the buzzing sounded like the humming of
bees; and when they alighted on Philip’s body it
was with difficulty he brushed them off, for their
legs seemed to contain deposits of glue, which held
them firmly in place until sometimes it was necessary
to actually dismember them.</p>

<p>His skin soon became a mass of blotches, for the
poison of the insects caused the wounds to swell like
boils, and it was no longer possible to distinguish his
features.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>




<h2 id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.<br />
<span class="smaller">DISAGREEABLE NEIGHBORS.</span></h2>

<p>Philip continued his flight, regardless either of
fatigue or the insects, through the brambles
which tore his flesh until, on passing half-around a
slight elevation which was covered with a greenish
white moss, he came upon a lake fully a mile in
length, and bordered by tall trees.</p>

<p>As nearly as could be judged he had traveled at
least three miles, and in this secluded and lovely
spot, which was so surrounded by foliage as to
render it impossible for him to peer into the thicket
further than two or three feet, it surely seemed as
if he was safe from his late tormentors.</p>

<p>The sensation of thirst was by this time so intense
as to be almost painful, and the sight of the
clear, sparkling water revived his spirits to a wonderful
degree.</p>

<p>Running forward eagerly, he knelt on the soft
turf at the edge of the lake, and remained in that
position ten or fifteen minutes, drinking at intervals
like one at a feast who is satisfied but delays
leaving the festive-board because of the enjoyment
of looking at the delicacies.</p>

<p>With his thirst assuaged Philip’s hopes revived.
He believed it would be possible to avoid the apes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
on an island of such extent as this appeared to be;
and when he finally raised his head it was to look
about him for the purpose of deciding in which direction
he would find refuge and shelter for the night.</p>

<p>As he did so, however, a cry of dismay burst from
his lips. On either hand for a distance of many
yards were the very apes from whom he was trying
to escape. All were kneeling as he knelt, and raising
their heads exactly as he raised his, with the
water running in streams from their muzzles.</p>

<p>No doubt they followed him through the thicket,
or made their way overhead among the branches;
but since the stick with which he had threatened
them was not in sight, all idea of punishing the intruder
was forgotten. Their faculties of imitation
proved greater than the love for mischief, and thus,
while he congratulated himself upon having escaped,
they had gathered noiselessly around him.</p>

<p>However dangerous the animal-trader’s position,
he could not restrain a loud burst of laughter at the
grotesque scene before him; but his mirth was very
quickly turned to surprise when he heard the sounds
of his own voice echoed from five hundred pairs of
lungs.</p>

<p>This mockery aroused still further his mirth, and
he laughed yet louder, the apes redoubling their
efforts until it seemed as if each hairy throat was
swollen almost to bursting.</p>

<p>It was an orchestra of the tropics with a leader
who had no pride in the achievements of his subordinates.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>As Philip sat up on his heels so did the animals,
and with their heads raised high in their effort
to emulate what they possibly thought was a song,
a bright blue object around the throats of fifteen or
twenty of the larger apes attracted the shipwrecked
boy’s attention.</p>

<p>It was hardly probable that the long-tailed denizens
of the woods were educated to the fashion of
wearing neckties, but yet there could be no question
that these select few had on such an article of
adornment. Not until after several moments did
Philip understand how prominent a part his own
neckerchief was playing in the scene. Each of the
apes thus decorated had secured a fragment of the
cravat, and, true to their imitative instincts, tied it
around his neck.</p>

<p>Now that his strange companions were in apparently
such a friendly mood, Philip thought it possible,
by abstaining from any threatening movements,
to get on with some degree of comfort, even
though they still continued to surround him.</p>

<p>To sleep just then was out of the question, for the
smaller members of the party were yet struggling
to laugh, and he looked around for something with
which to appease his hunger, which had increased
very decidedly since his thirst was satisfied.</p>

<p>He gazed scrutinizingly along the borders of the
lake, hoping to see at least some fresh-water mussels.
The apes did the same, although probably not with
a similar hope.</p>

<p>His eyes roamed among the foliage. So did those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
of his companions. He saw on a number of trees
near the water fruit of a bright yellow color, resembling
a crab-apple in shape. If the apes observed
the same they made no mention of the fact.</p>

<p>The trees were at least two hundred feet tall,
with branches shooting from their very tops, and to
climb up these smooth trunks, where there was not
the slightest support for either hand or foot, was an
utter impossibility.</p>

<p>To throw a stone so high with any degree of accuracy
would be rather a difficult matter; but yet
Philip resolved to try it. The shore of the lake in
certain places was covered with small, sharp, flint-like
stones, and thus there was plenty of ammunition
at hand, even if he should be forced to try very
many times before succeeding.</p>

<p>The first shot was not a success. The stone, after
striking the trunk of the tree a few feet below the
branches, bounded among the foliage with a loud
noise.</p>

<p>The apes, who had been intently watching all his
movements, hardly waited until the stone reached
the ground before the entire party gathered armfuls
of stones and began to fling them at the topmost
branches, causing the leaves and fruit to fly in every
direction.</p>

<p>The smaller animals, who could not send the missiles
so high, formed a chain, and passing the ammunition
from hand to hand, supplied those who were
more skillful, until that particular portion of the forest
was almost entirely denuded of its foliage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>Impelled by his hunger Philip seized a handful of
the small fruits, which were evidently a species of
guava, and began to eat eagerly.</p>

<p>At that instant the army of stone-throwers ceased
their labor as each gathered a supply of fruit, and
began eating exactly as did their human companion.
When he raised one of the guavas to his mouth they
imitated his exact movement. When he chewed
they worked their jaws most industriously. When
he ejected a seed from his mouth a perfect shower
of seeds fell upon the sand. If he threw away a
stem they repeated the action; and when, by chance,
he made a smacking noise with his lips, the shore of
the lake resounded with such a snapping and clattering
of jaws as would have caused the “end-man”
of a minstrel troupe to grow exceedingly green with
envy.</p>

<p>The abundant harvest which, when it was first
gathered, gave promise of supplying Philip with
food for many days, was disposed of in a very few
moments. Before his hunger was satisfied the last
guava had disappeared, and the army of apes looked
up expectantly, wondering what was to be the next
move in this queer sport.</p>

<p>It may seem comical to have one’s every gesture
repeated by four or five hundred long-tailed, human-like
animals, but it soon becomes annoying, to use
the mildest term.</p>

<p>During fully fifteen minutes Philip sat silent and
motionless, not daring so much as to raise his finger
lest ten or twelve hundred fingers should be pointed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
toward him; and his companions observed the same
immobility.</p>

<p>The approach of night, which comes on so rapidly
in the tropics, gave him plenty of food for reflection
as he sat there surrounded by his statue-like companions.
To remain in the forest during the hours
of darkness with such a following was something
that filled him with dread, for it was impossible to
say at what moment their capricious fancies might
lead to another attack, and he racked his brain in
vain for some answer to the vexed question.</p>

<p>He had every reason to believe that during the
next day he should find human beings who, however
unfriendly, would at least relieve him of this
throng of attendants, for the island was apparently
so large that it seemed hardly probable it was uninhabited.
Thus, according to his belief, the only
difficulties to be encountered were from this time
until morning.</p>

<p>But how and where should the night be passed?</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>




<h2 id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.<br />
<span class="smaller">A SINGULAR DISAPPEARANCE.</span></h2>

<p>The length of time which Philip remained
motionless caused the apes to show signs of
the greatest discontent. In their monkey minds
there was no sport in thus sitting like statues, and
two of the largest decided to make matters more
agreeable to themselves if not to their human companion.</p>

<p>He continued to sit under the shade of the palm-tree
where the feast had been brought to such an
abrupt conclusion by the rapid consumption of the
eatables, and these two leaders approached in a
manner which was evidently friendly, but at the
same time most inquisitive.</p>

<p>They first smelled of him, touched his hands,
face and hair, and proceeded on the work of examination
down to his feet, where they suddenly
discovered that the shoes were not a portion of his
body.</p>

<p>With a scream of delight one of the examiners
removed the foot-covering, and then evinced the
most profound astonishment at being able to take
off the stockings also.</p>

<p>The shipwrecked man’s toes next attracted his
attention, and he amused himself by moving them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
back and forth, evidently wondering why this
stranger should be formed almost as perfectly as
himself.</p>

<p>The other ape, chagrined at not having made as
important a discovery as his companion, now gave
the most profound attention to Philip’s trousers,
catching hold of the lower portion and attempting
to pull them off.</p>

<p>How to check these investigations, which might
be more than inconvenient when the main body of
apes should consider it their duty to take part in
the operation, was what Philip could not decide,
as, when he stood in the midst of the throng during
the first meeting, he dared not make any threatening
gestures; and it is very probable he would
speedily have been disrobed had not several of the
spectators strenuously objected to the two leaders
monopolizing all the sport.</p>

<p>This objection was first shown when a dozen of
the party began pulling at Philip’s coat and vest,
some even going so far as to fancy his hair might be
easily removed, and dragging out large handfuls by
the roots. Before five minutes had elapsed another
squad marched up to perform their part in the
entertainment.</p>

<p>Owing to the inability of all to participate in the
sport, these last seemed to consider it a solemn duty
to prevent their companions from enjoying themselves,
and then ensued a rough-and-tumble fight in
which Philip certainly played the part of “under
dog.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>They screamed, tugged, pulled, and yelled over
his prostrate body without either side gaining the
mastery, and although he received many bruises and
scratches, it was preferable to being entirely disrobed,
or to seeing his garments decorating the
bodies of his antagonists or companions, whichever
we may call them.</p>

<p>Had he remained immovable much longer his
clothes would speedily have been torn into shreds
by the yelling, scrambling crew around him; and to
lose this artificial covering in a forest through which
one could not walk without being seriously wounded
by the brambles would be almost as fatal as a
desperate encounter. Therefore, for the first time
since meeting these strange inhabitants he decided
to stand upon the defensive.</p>

<p>By dint of much pushing and pulling, and at the
expense of many scratches, he succeeded in extricating
himself from the combatants, but only to be
confronted by a fresh force of assailants, who were
lingering on the outside of the struggling crowd.
These, following the example of their leaders,
seemed to consider it the proper thing to engage
him in battle, and in a very few seconds it became
absolutely necessary to defend himself with force.</p>

<p>“It’s death if I don’t shoot, and it can be no worse
if I kill four or five; besides, the report of the revolver
may frighten them,” he said to himself as,
backing against a gigantic palm-tree, he drew and
leveled the weapon directly at the foremost ape.</p>

<p>His position at this moment was most critical.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
That he would be torn in pieces as had been his
cravat, after shooting the first ape, seemed inevitable;
but he said grimly, between his set teeth:</p>

<p>“It is better to die while fighting than to yield
without a struggle,” and he took deliberate aim.</p>

<p>Another second and the weapon would have been
discharged, unless, indeed, as was quite possible, its
long immersion in the sea had rendered it useless.</p>

<p>Just as he was on the point of pressing the trigger
a terrific shriek, such as it would hardly seem
could have come from any pair of lungs, however
vigorous, was heard some distance in the rear, and
was prolonged until the echoes sent it rolling down
the lake like detonations of thunder.</p>

<p>Philip stared about him in alarm, trying in vain
to discover the meaning of this strange noise, and
to his great astonishment the crowd of apes started
with the rapidity of the wind in the direction from
which the shriek had come.</p>

<p>On every hand among the foliage could be seen
for one brief second the disappearing tails of his
troublesome companions, and then he was left
alone, the tumult in the distance growing fainter
and fainter, as this army of animals dispersed at the
highest rate of speed, until finally all was hushed
and still.</p>

<p>He was alone on the border of the lake. Silence
and solitude had in the twinkling of an eye replaced
the frightful tumult, and the shadows of night were
closing rapidly around him.</p>

<p>Utter despair gave way to hope. Now that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
was alone, the possible dangers to be encountered in
the forest during the hours of darkness were as
nothing compared to the relief he felt at having lost
sight of the grinning, chattering apes.</p>

<p>It might be possible to find human beings before
the mantle of night had been fully spread over the
land, and he made his preparations for continuing
the tramp as calmly as if his life had never been
threatened. The most important task was to regain
possession of his shoes and stockings, for without
them it would be a matter of impossibility to walk
a hundred yards, and he began the most careful
search on the scene of the late encounter.</p>

<p>When, after not more than five minutes’ hunt, the
missing and highly necessary articles were found,
he accepted it as a good omen, and was almost convinced
that he would soon have food and shelter
among human beings. This belief was strengthened
by the terrific shriek which brought the battle of
the apes to such a sudden end. He felt positive
that the noise had been made by some contrivance
of man’s, although why the apes rushed directly toward
it was what he could not explain.</p>

<p>From among the branches cut off when the animals
were bombarding the trees he selected the
stoutest one as a cane, as well as an additional
weapon of defense, and then started around the
lake, hoping to find the outlet, which must necessarily
flow into the sea, before it became necessary
to halt for the night.</p>

<p>At this place, if anywhere, would he come upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
the inhabitants of the island; and as his late tormentors
might return at any moment after sunrise—it
was hardly probable they would do so during the
night—time must be economized at the risk of meeting
with wild animals in the jungle.</p>

<p>Following along the shore of the lake for fully
half an hour, he met with no obstacles save where
the foliage came in a matted tangle close to the
water, and then the sound as of a cascade fell upon
his ears.</p>

<p>He had arrived at the destination set; but not
content to remain here, although the darkness was
almost impenetrable, he continued on down the bank
of this waterfall until arriving at a second, ending in
a basin from which, contrary to his expectations,
flowed a stream of considerable size.</p>

<p>It was evident the coast was further away than he
had fancied; and weary in limb as well as sore in
body he halted for the night.</p>

<p>The sleep that came to his eyelids was neither
profound nor refreshing. He made for himself such
a bed as could be formed of leaves and moss; but
on lying down, the strangeness of his surroundings
and the fear of what might be lurking in the darkness
prevented his eyes from closing many moments
at a time.</p>

<p>It was a relief rather than otherwise when the
surrounding objects began to stand out from a background
of violet, and he knew the coming day was
sending heralds abroad to announce its near approach.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>A welcome breeze, the accompaniment of sunrise,
swept across the jungle, cooling his fevered brow,
and the fact that it was not heated caused him to
believe the sea but a short distance away. As he
arose to his feet, following the conformation of the
stream, the thicket became less dense, and the foliage
so scanty that one could see many yards ahead,
until, when the sun showed itself above the horizon,
not two hundred yards off the waves of the boundless
ocean were revealed to view.</p>

<p>To his disappointment there were no signs of inhabitants;
but it might be possible a village was
located further up on the shore, and he made his
way along the beach, halting at every sound in the
thicket, fearing his old enemies might be in pursuit.</p>

<p>During the first hour he saw nothing to encourage,
save it might be in the thousands of oysters
which were spread out on the beach, a goodly portion
of which had been opened, not naturally, but
with the aid of a little stone placed between the
shells.</p>

<p>Philip knew that this must be a favorite feeding-ground
for such inhabitants of the island as he had
already met. Oysters are a luxury to the entire
monkey tribe, who succeed in procuring the bivalves
by a variety of cunning means, the most common of
which is to throw a stone between the shells when
the oyster chances to be open. In this manner they
are sure of their prey without having to run the
risk of getting their paws or muzzles caught in the
powerful grip of the shell-fish.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>Some monkeys, as Philip knew from what he had
read on the subject, particularly those of Burmah,
open the oyster with a stone by striking the base of
the upper valve until it dislocates or breaks, and
then extract the meat with their fingers, occasionally
putting the shell straight to their mouths.</p>

<p>The necessity of observing and understanding
every object in his path, for the purpose
of learning as much as possible concerning the
island, caused the traveler to scan these shells carefully.
The fact that monkeys are adept oyster-openers
had no interest for him, save as it was the
means of showing that human beings had not
visited this portion of the shore; therefore he understood
it would be necessary to look elsewhere for
aid.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>




<h2 id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.<br />
<span class="smaller">A PERILOUS PREDICAMENT.</span></h2>

<p>Not having had guavas sufficient for anything
more than the lightest kind of a light
lunch, the shipwrecked youth searched among the
shells for oysters. It was a laborious way of earning
a dinner, since the monkeys had cleaned out the
meats pretty thoroughly, and an hour’s hard work
did not reward him with more than a dozen of the
tiny bivalves.</p>

<p>His hunger was so great that he would have continued
this almost futile search longer, but for the
fact that the sun was sending an intense heat down
upon the exposed beach, and already had he begun
to feel the greatest inconvenience, and even pain.
Prostration, if nothing worse, would most surely follow,
unless he beat a speedy retreat.</p>

<p>To regain the shelter of the woods was absolutely
necessary despite the desire for food; but before
doing so Philip believed it of the highest importance
that he should contrive some signal which might
possibly attract the attention of those on board
passing vessels.</p>

<p>The means for doing such work were limited, yet
he did succeed in raising what might, perhaps, be
seen half a mile away, although knowing full well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
that no trading-vessels would venture so near the
inhospitable coast.</p>

<p>Cutting the straightest and tallest stick of bamboo
which could be found within a distance of a
hundred yards, he stripped it of the leaves, and to
the top fastened one of the two white handkerchiefs
he had about him at the time of the shipwreck.
This feeble attempt at a signal was planted firmly in
the sand, and by the expenditure of considerable
labor he heaped around the base a huge quantity of
shells.</p>

<p>As far up and down the shore as the eye could
reach a line of reef extended fully a quarter of a
mile into the sea, and it was with a feeling of
despondency that he looked at the fruits of his labor,
knowing there was but little chance the fluttering
cloth could bring any one to his relief.</p>

<p>To continue the journey around the coast would
be to expose himself to the direct rays of the sun,
and inasmuch as the reef precluded the possibility of
a settlement in the vicinity, Philip determined to
make his way directly across the island.</p>

<p>To that end he went straight into the underbrush
toward the south, keeping careful watch on every
hand lest he should be surprised by any of his
former monkey acquaintances, and at the expiration
of an hour was clambering up the side of a rocky
elevation.</p>

<p>Of course it would have been possible to travel
around the base of this hill, but the hope that from
the summit he might obtain a good view of the odd<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
land on which he had been thrown caused him to
court rather than avoid labor.</p>

<p>While making his way through the trees, pausing
now and then to brush away the insects which
rendered every movement so painful, he saw
descending from a palm what he mistook for a flying-squirrel.
With but little hope that he could
succeed in capturing this tiny game, which would
make a tempting lunch for one in his half-famished
condition, he darted forward.</p>

<p>There was no difficulty in catching the supposed
squirrel, for it proved to be anything rather than
active in its movements, and as Philip’s fingers
clutched the body he found to his surprise that he
had seized a huge frog whose deep green skin
looked, in the dim light, so much like fur.</p>

<p>Naturalist though he was, Philip had never before
seen such a specimen as this. The toes were very
long and webbed at their extremities, so that upon
being expanded they presented a surface much
larger than the body. The fore-legs were also
bordered by a membrane, and it was evident the
frog was inflated during the leap, for he shrank to
one-half his previous size immediately the hunter
grasped him.</p>

<p>There could be no mistake but that this was the
veritable flying-frog of the Malay Archipelago, and
Philip examined it with great interest. The back
and legs were of a deep green, while the under-surface
was yellow, as were also the webs of the
feet, each of which covered a surface of about four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
square inches. The extremities of the toes were
formed similar to those of a tree-frog, and it is probable
the membrane was intended to be used as often
for swimming as for flying.</p>

<p>It was not a particularly dainty morsel of food,
however, and after satisfying his curiosity concerning
it Philip set the little fellow at liberty, he continuing
on up the difficult ascent.</p>

<p>He expended his strength uselessly in climbing
the hill, however, for when the highest point of the
elevation had been gained it was not possible to see
anything above the surrounding trees. His fatigue
and disappointment might have caused him to give
way in despair if, just at the moment when his
mental troubles were greatest, he had not observed
a small animal, evidently some species of deer,
about two hundred yards away.</p>

<p>The desire for food now outweighed all other
considerations, and he crept forward among the
scanty foliage with his revolver in hand, hoping a
chance shot might supply him with a dinner.</p>

<p>When it was no longer possible to approach without
danger of being seen, he took careful aim over
the top of a bowlder and discharged two barrels of
his weapon in rapid succession.</p>

<p>The deer sprang into the air and then staggered
forward; but instead of falling, as the hunter so
ardently desired, he started down the sharp descent
on the south side of the hill.</p>

<p>Philip forgot his fatigue and pursued, taking a
course at right-angles with the one made by the animal,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
in order to intercept him at the point of bushes
which was evidently his destination.</p>

<p>With his eye fixed on the deer, noting not the nature
of the ground over which he traveled, Philip
rushed forward, gaining rapidly on his prey. At
the objective point of foliage the animal halted for
an instant, and the hunter bent every energy toward
increasing his speed.</p>

<p>When his pursuer was hardly three yards away
the deer disappeared, and thinking he had merely
taken refuge behind the bushes, Philip darted
around the other side, only to stop suddenly as he
saw a chasm yawning before him.</p>

<p>He attempted to check himself so suddenly that a
small stone was loosened under his foot, throwing
him forward with still greater impetus, and it became
impossible to regain a foot-hold.</p>

<p>At the very edge of the precipice he clutched
wildly at what seemed to be a bush, as he was literally
hurled among the branches. This slight support
gave way beneath his weight, and he dropped
his revolver to seize with both hands the trunk of
the bush.</p>

<p>Down, down he went, seemingly a great distance,
but still holding on for dear life; and then the foliage
swung upward again in the rebound, carrying
him with it, as a matter of course.</p>

<p>Hanging like an apple on a limb, he swayed to
and fro, up and down, until the trunk upon which
his very life depended had settled into nearly a stationary
position.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>Now it could be seen that he had dropped hardly
more than twenty feet from the brow of the cliff;
but this was not exactly cheering information, for
he was hanging over a sheer descent of thirty or
forty yards. That which he had mistaken for a
bush was simply the upper portion of a reasonably
large tree which grew on a shelf of the rock ten or
twelve feet below the crest of the ledge.</p>

<p>He was grasping the trunk within three or four
feet of the very top, and his weight made a tremendous
strain upon the root. The wood was
tough, however, and fortunately for him he bent so
far from the cliff as to be suspended almost at right-angles
with it.</p>

<p>These points were noted with the quickness of
thought at the same time that a plan for saving himself
came like a flash of light into his mind.</p>

<p>Before the strain on his arms should grow too
great he determined to pull himself along the trunk
like an acrobat on a horizontal bar. He could not
do this, however, without causing the tree to sway
violently again, and it became necessary to throw
one leg over the yielding wood, where he hung in
imminent danger not only of slipping off, but of
being carried down the precipice together with that
which he clutched so desperately, for it was only a
question of time before the roots would be torn
from their slight hold.</p>

<p>Therefore it became essential that the attempt at
escape should be made in another direction.</p>

<p>Carefully letting himself down until he was once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
more in the first position, he worked his way, with
every muscle strained to its utmost tension, hand
over hand toward the roots, impeded by twigs and
branches until the task seemed well-nigh impossible.</p>

<p>Each inch gained in this direction caused the tree
to resume more nearly its original position, until
when he was a little more than half way toward the
base the trunk stood upright, and by dropping down
he succeeded in reaching the narrow ledge, from
which to gain the top of the cliff was a reasonably
easy task.</p>

<p>When Philip was once more in a place of safety
it became necessary to rest his weary limbs before
going in search of the game that had so nearly cost
him his life. Lying prone upon the earth for fifteen
minutes was sufficient to give him the required
strength, and then he began to search for a practicable
path to the foot of the precipice.</p>

<p>A detour of a quarter of a mile was sufficient to
take him from the edge of the cliff to the rocky side
of the hill, down which it was possible to make his
way without any great difficulty.</p>

<p>Despite the pangs of hunger his first care was the
revolver, and he followed up the narrow ravine or
gully, which was thickly overgrown with shrubs,
until he stood directly beneath the tree which had
saved him from a terrible fall. Here he searched the
ground in vain, and was about to give up the task to
find the trail of the deer when glancing, by chance,
along the side of the cliff, he saw the weapon lodged
in the branches of a stout sapling, while not more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
than thirty feet distant was an immense panther
standing over the mangled carcass of the game.</p>

<p>Surely he was between the horns of a dilemma
now. Both his revolver and the postponed dinner
were so near the ferocious animal that it would be
as dangerous to make any attempt at getting one as
the other, and during several moments he stood undecided,
knowing that the first step taken in retreat
would bring the beast upon him.</p>

<p>A youth less versed in the habits of wild animals
than Philip Garland might unwittingly have brought
on an encounter to which there could be but one
end. He, however, remained motionless, save as he
worked his way, inch by inch, toward a thicket of
shrubs without lifting his feet from the ground.</p>

<p>Even this stealthy retreat was noted by the animal,
who began to twitch its tail as if preparing for
a leap, and the shipwrecked youth knew he could no
longer hold the enemy by his gaze nor gain the desired
shelter. There was little opportunity for further
preparation. The panther was already crouching
for the spring.</p>

<p>Mentally bracing himself for that which seemed
inevitable, he awaited the supreme moment with but
one faint hope in his mind—that it might be possible
to jump aside while the animal was in the air.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>




<h2 id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.<br />
<span class="smaller">A TERRIBLE FIGHT.</span></h2>

<p>Just at the instant when Philip Garland believed
his career as a trader in wild animals was to be
ended by death the panther turned his head slightly
and began to paw up the leaves, his tail moving angrily
from side to side, much as if an adversary was
approaching from the opposite direction. At the
same moment was heard a fierce growling and
snarling from the left, a short distance away, followed
immediately by the sound of claws raking
the bark as this new-comer evidently sprang into a
tree.</p>

<p>There was now an opportunity for the shipwrecked
youth to make his escape; but the fascination
of the scene held him spell-bound.</p>

<p>The panther, who had been standing guard over
the deer, crouched for an instant with every muscle
quivering, and then leaped high in the air as a huge
body shot from out the foliage with the force and
velocity of a cannon-ball, the two animals coming
together with a shock several feet from the ground.</p>

<p>The combatants rolled over and over, snarling like
cats, full twenty paces from where the revolver
hung suspended, and Philip moved cautiously forward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
without being observed by either of the participants
in the deadly strife.</p>

<p>A moment later he had secured the weapon, and
made his way with considerable difficulty up the
side of the cliff until he arrived at a stout but not
tall tree, within view of the animals. To ascend the
trunk of this was but the work of a moment, and he
seated himself among the branches to await the
result of the sanguinary battle.</p>

<p>Over and over the two panthers rolled, snarling
and tearing at each other’s throats as they uttered
from time to time such roars as seemingly caused
the very air to tremble.</p>

<p>During fully fifteen minutes these huge cats tore
and slashed, each gripping his adversary’s neck, and
at the expiration of that time one arose to his feet
with a mighty roar. The other lay dead, his glossy
coat cut into ribbons, and his life-blood staining the
foliage for a dozen feet on either side.</p>

<p>Whether the victor was the one who had first confronted
him Philip could not decide; but he came
directly toward the carcass, after licking his wounds;
and now the question arose as to whether the
hungry man should see his dinner devoured when,
possibly, he had the means of preventing it.</p>

<p>Recharging the two chambers of the weapon
which had been emptied into the body of the deer,
Philip took careful aim between the panther’s eyes
and fired.</p>

<p>The ball simply grazed the animal’s skull, half
stunning him for an instant, and causing him to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
whirl around in such a manner that there was no
chance of firing a second shot with any degree of
accuracy.</p>

<p>With an angry scream the panther leaped to his
feet once more, immediately searching for this new
antagonist, whom he discovered with but little
difficulty after a few seconds. The blood blinded
his eyes; but he made a desperate leap with such
effect that one of his huge paws brushed Philip’s
foot. The foliage was not sufficiently thick to check
the impetus of his jump, and he fell on the opposite
side with a force that rolled him over half a dozen
times.</p>

<p>Philip could not afford to waste ammunition,
therefore he decided to fire only when there was a
probability of hitting the mark fairly; and from his
reasonably safe position he watched the antics of
the enraged animal.</p>

<p>Three different times did the panther run back
from the tree and then spring toward his enemy,
but never leaping higher than at the first attempt.
With each failure he lost more and more of his
temper. He rolled on the ground and roared in
impotent rage, made frantic rushes at the tree, and
twice climbed nearly to where Philip sat.</p>

<p>Four times did the hunter fire point-blank at the
animal; but little execution was done, save to
further enrage the beast, because of the foliage
which impeded the view.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p class="caption">As Philip emerged from the ravine he discovered a panther
standing over the game.—(<a href="#Page_67">See page 67.</a>)</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>It was not until after fully an hour had passed
that the panther settled down on his haunches and
gazed steadily at the tree, as if trying to decide
what his next move should be.</p>

<p>This was the opportunity for which Philip had
waited, and with a well-directed shot he ended the
contest, tumbling the huge cat over, where, after a
few spasmodic twitches of the muscles, he lay
motionless and dead.</p>

<p>When Philip became convinced there was no
longer any life in the beast he descended from the
tree, hastily cut out a quarter of the deer, and made
his way with all possible speed down the ravine, for
the neighborhood was one in which he did not care
to linger. Under other circumstances he might
have had sufficient curiosity to examine the bodies
of the animals; but just now it was dinner, not
natural history, in which he was interested, and his
one thought was to roast as quickly as possible the
meat which had so nearly cost him his life.</p>

<p>By following up the ravine toward the east he
came upon a small stream which had its source
among a series of hills, of which the one he ascended
was the westernmost, and here he halted.</p>

<p>After gathering a quantity of dry twigs and
leaves he soon started a blaze by discharging his
revolver directly into the inflammable material, and
half an hour later his hunger was satisfied with
venison steaks, several of which were eaten before
the fire had made any very great change in their
appearance.</p>

<p>The fatigue, excitement and mental distress of the
past three days had wearied him to the verge of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
exhaustion, and now that the desire for food was
appeased he hastened to enjoy the repose so sadly
needed.</p>

<p>Among some tamarind-trees which grew near the
edge of the stream he laid down, after hanging the
remnant of meat among the branches for safe-keeping,
and hardly was his head upon the mossy pillow
ere his eyes closed in the most profound slumber.</p>

<p>How long that sleep lasted he knew not, save
from the fact that when he closed his eyes the sun
was in the zenith, and on opening them again it was
precisely at the same point; therefore it seemed as if
what was intended for a short nap must have continued
exactly twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>The meat hung where he left it; but the tropical
sun had already begun to taint it. To a man in
Philip’s position such an incident is but trifling, and
despite its condition he broiled for himself another
meal, saying, as he did so:</p>

<p>“I sha’n’t miss the seasoning while it is so rank,
therefore there is no great loss without some small
gain.”</p>

<p>After the repast was ended he remained seated in
the shelter of the trees trying to form some plan of
relief, when he became aware of a certain rustling
near-by which could not have been produced by the
gentle breeze among the foliage.</p>

<p>Any unusual sound, however slight, in such a place
demanded immediate attention, because of the
variety of enemies he had already met, and with his
revolver ready for instant use he advanced cautiously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
toward the spot from whence the noise appeared
to proceed.</p>

<p>Slowly, on tiptoe and with bated breath, he continued
his way to a thicket of mimosas, and raising
the thorny branches with the utmost caution peered
forward at that which caused him to stand as if spell-bound
with horror.</p>

<p>Before him, suspended to the branches of a tree,
was a huge skeleton, its bones, which were bleached
white as ivory, standing out in vivid contrast against
the dark green leaves.</p>

<p>It was some moments before Philip could control
his emotions sufficiently to approach this horrible
object; but when he did so, alarm gave way to surprise.
He seized the foot of the rustling, ominous-looking
fruit borne by the mimosa, but it proved to
be a hand. In an instant he understood that the
skeleton was that of an ape—a gigantic mandrill,
enemy of the baboon, with whom it shares the empire
of ferocity.</p>

<p>Judging from the size of the bones, Philip knew
that the ape to which it formerly belonged must
have surpassed in size and strength any of the
species he had ever seen; but how it chanced to
be suspended in such a manner was something concerning
which he could form no plausible idea.</p>

<p>That the animal had been skinned before being
strung up like a malefactor was apparent from the
fact that no fragment of hide was to be found at
the bottom of the tree or clinging to the bones.</p>

<p>Improbable as was the thought, Philip fancied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
he looked upon the evidences of an execution. It
surely appeared as if the mandrill had been hanged,
and then, to make the punishment more degrading,
skinned after death.</p>

<p>As may be supposed, Philip did not linger long in
this vicinity. His own condition afforded plenty of
food for sorrow, and there was no necessity to torture
his mind with a sinister object such as called
forth speculations which could not be otherwise than
painful.</p>

<p>The suspended skeleton had the effect, however,
of lessening his troubles to a certain extent, for as
he made his way toward the east once more there
was in his mind plenty of food for thought other
than the forlorn condition in which he had so suddenly
been plunged.</p>

<p>What spot on this vast globe had he found where
apes usurped the place of man? And was there a
human being dwelling on the island? How did it
happen that the different species of monkeys he had
seen were so familiar with man?</p>

<p>This last question caused him to have more faith
that he would soon find others of his kind, and he
pressed forward with renewed hope and vigor.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.<br />
<span class="smaller">A REMARKABLE GATHERING.</span></h2>

<p>Refreshed by the profound slumber, and his
mind fully occupied with thoughts called forth
by the discovery of the skeleton, Philip continued
straight on, knowing not where he was going until
nightfall. So intent was he on this subject that he
felt no fatigue, but traveled like one in a dream
through the forest, which was partially illumined
by the moon; and not until this pale, cold light underwent
a most complete change did he fully realize
what was passing around him.</p>

<p>The diminution of light, the gray, reddish mist
which arose on the air, came from no natural cause,
and Philip instinctively climbed a tree to gain, if
possible, a more extended view.</p>

<p>To his great joy, from this point of vantage he
could see flames on the further side of the island.
Fire betokened the presence of human beings, and
with a glad cry Philip descended from the tree to
press forward at full speed.</p>

<p>The conflagration, however, was much further
away than he at first supposed. An hour passed,
and yet he had not approached near enough to discern
it through the thicket. Several times, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
following the depressions of the land, his range of
vision was so obscured that it became necessary to
again climb a tree to make certain he was pursuing
the proper direction, and after four hours had
elapsed the guiding light died away entirely.</p>

<p>He was now without any means of shaping a
course, and, knowing full well the folly of traveling
at random in a forest during the night when objects
are distorted by the gloom, he came to a halt.</p>

<p>While groping around to find a suitable place in
which to sleep, he discovered, to his great surprise,
that the trees no longer grew at irregular intervals,
but were standing in straight rows, as if planted by
the hand of man. The soil had every appearance
of having been tilled; instead of walking on a
springy turf, or over the decaying leaves of the
jungle, his feet sunk in the loam. The foliage no
longer presented such a variety of plants, but was
all of the same species and covered thickly with
fruit.</p>

<p>Plucking one from a branch that bent down
within reach he discovered that it was a guava, produced
by a regular system of culture. There was
an absence of harshness which characterizes this
fruit in its natural state, and the discovery was further
proof to him that human beings dwelt upon the
island.</p>

<p>After a light repast of the pleasant-flavored but
ill-smelling apple he lay down to rest, and did not
awaken until a terrific uproar, similar to that which
so startled his disagreeable companions the first day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
of his arrival at the island, rang out on the clear
air.</p>

<p>The din, indistinct at first, assumed the various
gradations belonging to the voices of wild animals—from
the tiger’s snarl and the howling of the hyena
to the most piercing shrieks and shrillest whistles.</p>

<p>It was but natural that Philip should feel thoroughly
alarmed, and make every effort to seek
refuge from this new danger which seemed close at
hand. Running forward he followed, without absolutely
intending to do so, the line of cultivated trees,
and at the further end, in what appeared to be a
vast thicket, he crouched, waiting until the sun
should reveal the denizens of the jungle.</p>

<p>The day, which in the tropics does not steal on by
degrees but bursts forth in a sudden glory, filled the
forest with dazzling light, and through the numerous
openings in the foliage Philip beheld that which
might seem to be improbable but for the fact that it
can be supported by the testimony of one of the
most celebrated German naturalists.</p>

<p>In a vast cleared space which formed a natural
arena was a group of individuals partially clad in
uniforms such as are worn by many of our merchant-sailors,
who believe that a distinctive dress on
shipboard is conducive to discipline.</p>

<p>The members of this gathering were seated on a
slight elevation apparently in grave deliberation, as
if holding a sort of court-martial, while among them
was one who towered above the others, with a cap
on which were three bands of gold-lace, and a coat
plentifully bedecked with the same material.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>It was not the uniforms nor the positions of these
individuals which surprised Philip. The cause of
his profound astonishment, amounting almost to
bewilderment, was the fact that the entire assembly
was composed of apes, and the one in authority
wore a uniform identical with that which Philip had
seen on Captain Seaworth the day when he and his
officers made the purchases at the animal-trainer’s
establishment.</p>

<p>Composing this court—if such it can be called—and
ranged about the leader in circles, were all
species of the monkey-tribe, or, to speak more correctly,
the ferocious members of that large family.
Each one was clad in some portion of a uniform,
but none save the leader boasted of an entire suit.
Two or three had nothing more than caps; others
wore trousers, and several displayed partial suits of
underclothing. One ape was the proud possessor of
a blue coat; another carried a saber with the belt
around his neck, while a number had the weapons
minus belts. Two or three were fortunate only in
having gloves, which were as often on their feet as
their hands. Some had coats on hind-side before
without any attempt at buttoning them, and not a
few were decorated with bright-colored ribbons.
Philip also noticed half a dozen who had portions of
female wearing apparel, such as dresses or capes.</p>

<p>The majority of the party were armed with some
kind of a weapon, either saber, boarding-pike, or
capstan-bar.</p>

<p>Philip hardly completed his inspection of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
singular-looking assembly when he who appeared to
be the leader began what was evidently a speech
lasting four or five minutes, and listened to with the
utmost gravity by all.</p>

<p>When he had concluded, half a dozen of those
nearest him marched solemnly into the thicket
opposite Philip’s hiding-place, and returned with
twenty of the most inoffensive of the monkey-tribe,
known as vervets, all of whom were securely bound
with ropes made from bark.</p>

<p>These were arraigned before the leader like so
many criminals, and he addressed them with a succession
of harsh, guttural cries until the poor
creatures vainly tried to escape from the awful
presence, but only to be dragged back by their captors,
who belabored them with bamboo sticks.</p>

<p>During fully a quarter of an hour this scene was
continued, and then, as if at a signal from the
leader, a squad of huge apes, each of whom was
armed with a long stick, began flogging the prisoners
unmercifully.</p>

<p>It was possible for Philip to hear the blows even
though so far away, and the unfortunate vervets
gave vent to the most plaintive cries, which sounded
very much like appeals for mercy.</p>

<p>The executioners—for such they appeared to be—continued
the punishment until seemingly wearied
with their cruel exertions, and then, unloosing their
bonds, drove the culprits from among them into the
depths of the forest.</p>

<p>No sooner was this done than the entire assembly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
crowded around the leader, stroking his back, licking
his hands, fawning at his feet, and in every possible
way showing the utmost respect mingled with
fear.</p>

<p>When the big ape had received sufficient adulation
to satisfy him he waved his hand by way of
signal for his followers to desist, and then, arising
majestically, started toward what was evidently a
continuation of the clearing, followed by his adherents.</p>

<p>If Philip’s surprise at this strange proceeding had
been great, one can imagine how much it was intensified
when he recognized in this pompous leader
none other than the gigantic Goliah whom he had
once owned and sold to Captain Seaworth!</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>




<h2 id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.<br />
<span class="smaller">AN ODD VILLAGE.</span></h2>

<p>Philip Garland’s surprise at seeing this vast
assembly of apes conducting themselves so thoroughly
after the manner of human beings was indeed
great; but to recognize in the leader of the
party an article of merchandise which he had sold to
Captain Seaworth was absolutely bewildering.</p>

<p>How had Goliah reached this particular island?
Had he taught these companions of his to imitate
man, or were they his instructors? In either case,
how did it happen that among these animals there
should be such a collection of weapons and clothing?</p>

<p>These questions Philip asked himself without
being able to make any reply. He was in that
mental condition when one’s will has no control
over the body, and half-unconsciously he followed
the procession as it left the open-air court-room,
although in his mind there was a very-well-defined
idea that by so doing he exposed himself to the
most extreme danger.</p>

<p>In his stupefaction—perhaps fascination would be
the better word—he advanced cautiously as if by
instinct, keeping well in the rear of the party, gliding
from tree-trunk to tree-trunk, and halting within<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
the cover of the foliage whenever any of the apes
showed an inclination to loiter.</p>

<p>It was during one of these forced halts, and while
obliged to remain concealed a longer time than
usual, that quite by accident he chanced to glance
through the thicket on his right, thereby increasing
surprise to the very verge of bewilderment.</p>

<p>He saw there, at a distance of thirty or forty
yards from where he stood, a collection of small huts
built in the fashion of hamlets such as one sees in
Java. Around these loitered a number of apes,
some few partially dressed in garments of European
manufacture, and the remainder clad only as nature
intended they should be; but nowhere could he perceive
a human being.</p>

<p>It was not possible that this monkey-tribe had
built these neat dwellings, which were ornamented
with paint, lighted by glass windows, and protected
from the sun’s fervent rays by awnings; but yet,
where were the builders? Where the rightful
inhabitants?</p>

<p>While standing in mute astonishment, with his
eyes fixed upon the tiny village, the procession from
the court had passed out of sight into the thicket
unheeded by him, who had no thought save that of
solving the strange riddle.</p>

<p>While only partially screened by the foliage
Philip was startled, almost alarmed, by a light touch
on his arm, and wheeling around suddenly, he saw
another of the animals sold by him to Captain Seaworth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>This was the chimpanzee Sweet Alice, and that
she recognized him there could be no mistake. Looking
up into his face, while at the same time plucking
at the sleeve of his coat and pointing toward the
village, she gave him to understand, almost as well
as could have been done by words, her desire to
have him follow.</p>

<p>Had Philip been in a less complete state of bewilderment
he would have hesitated before entering
the little town, where, undoubtedly, his arrival
would be communicated to the huge baboon and he
find himself a prisoner once more. But in his present
frame of mind nothing seemed more natural
than to accede to the chimpanzee’s mute request,
and he motioned her to lead the way.</p>

<p>Instead of going directly toward the buildings
she moved off at right-angles with them, looking
cautiously from side to side as if to let him understand
that their advance should be concealed as far
as possible, and he followed her every movement.</p>

<p>During fifteen minutes the stealthy march was
continued, interrupted now and then as the chimpanzee
stopped to listen or crept nearer to the edge
of the clearing to reconnoiter, and in all this time
they had seen but one other member of the tribe.
He was evidently a laborer, and failed to see the
stranger because of his occupation, which consisted
of splitting logs with his fingers and an ax. He
handled the tool very awkwardly, but yet with a
certain air which caused Philip to believe man had
been his teacher.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>On emerging from the thicket the traveler discovered
that they had arrived at the outskirts of
the village in the rear of the houses, opposite the
point where he first caught a glimpse of the settlement.
Here was a row of iron-barred cages, all but
one of which were empty, and toward this particular
prison the chimpanzee advanced, beckoning her
companion to follow.</p>

<p>Hesitatingly he did so, and looking through the
bars saw the other animal he had sold to Captain
Seaworth—Ben Bolt!</p>

<p>The sight of this captive gave Philip a solution to
the riddle, and he uttered a low exclamation of surprise
that he had not sooner guessed it.</p>

<p>There could no longer be any question but that
he was on the island where the corporation, whose
agent Captain Seaworth was, had started their
colony.</p>

<p>Upon examining the iron cages more closely he
saw that they were the same taken from his establishment
when the animals were purchased, and in
them had been confined the gigantic Goliah. But
how had he escaped? Where was the captain and
those who had been brought out as colonists?</p>

<p>It was hardly possible the tribe of monkeys could
have vanquished the entire party, and not probable
Goliah had been released until the human beings
were disposed of in some way. Was this seeming
capture of the village the sequel to a story of which
he had seen the first chapter in the skeleton among
the mimosas?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>Philip had solved one problem only to find himself
confronted by another yet more perplexing and
painful. He was on the very island where his
friends had landed, and yet no signs of them could
be seen save in the clothing, the cottages, and the
behavior of the apes.</p>

<p>These thoughts passed through the shipwrecked
youth’s mind very rapidly. Only for a few moments
did he stand undecided before the cage which
confined Ben Bolt, and then he drew the bars, allowing
the unhappy captive to go free.</p>

<p>Instantly the chimpanzee was released he rushed
toward Philip, fawning around him several minutes,
and then turned to Alice, whom he greeted with
every evidence of affection. During fully five minutes
these two animals capered like dogs who evince
joy at a master’s return. Then Alice suddenly
raised her head as if in fear, lowering it again as
the hair on her neck stood erect like that of an angry
cat’s, while she motioned with one paw toward
the forest, and with the other thrust Ben Bolt back
into the cage, expressing by every gesture her desire
that the door should be fastened again.</p>

<p>So much intelligence had these chimpanzees displayed
while in his establishment that the animal-trainer
felt no hesitation about following the mute
instructions; and the bars were hardly replaced
when hoarse, guttural cries in the distance told that
Goliah was approaching.</p>

<p>To remain there longer would undoubtedly be to
find himself in the power of his former chattel. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
such case, what revenge might not the gigantic
baboon take? If the chimpanzees remembered him
so well, Goliah’s memory would hardly be less retentive,
and the floggings so often administered
might be repaid with compound interest.</p>

<p>It seemed that Alice understood this as well as did
Philip, for on her face were the liveliest expressions
of terror, and she plucked at his coat-sleeve trying
to draw him away, while pointing toward the forest
from whence came the hoarse cries.</p>

<p>There was no longer any time for hesitation, and
trusting himself implicitly to the guidance of the
chimpanzee, Philip followed, the two passing the rear
of the cages just as the baboon went by in front to
visit the prisoner.</p>

<p>Not an ape was to be seen on the principal street
of the village, and as they walked past the buildings
Philip had an opportunity of examining their condition.</p>

<p>What at a distance appeared to be a collection of
neat cottages proved, on closer inspection, to be
hardly more than ruins. The windows of the houses
were broken, the frames splintered, and the greater
portion wrenched entirely out of their casings.
From the second stories, hanging on long poles, were
torn uniforms, cravats, boots, belts, hats, empty bottles,
trousers, towels, rags of all colors, shirts, and
even a few flags. The paint was defaced, the fences
were torn down, and everywhere on the ground were
scattered bones, fragments of glass and crockery, and
tins which once contained canned meats or vegetables.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
In several places where crops had been growing
could now be seen only dried stalks. The
chicken-coops, which were attached to nearly every
dwelling, had been wrecked, and the feathers scattered
here and there told the fate of their occupants.</p>

<p>It was a scene of pillage and waste such as would
have shamed the hangers-on of any army, however
demoralized; and Philip, now hardly more than a
fugitive, thought with dismay of those who had probably
met their death while trying to found this
colony. Never since the shipwreck had he been so
thoroughly dispirited, and but for the constant tugging
of the chimpanzee at his garments he might
have lingered until it would be no longer possible to
escape. She literally pulled him along through the
tiny village until the seclusion of the thicket was
gained, when her movements became more leisurely,
and he understood that there was no longer any
necessity for such rapid flight.</p>

<p>Probably because the chimpanzee believed they
were safe for the time being from Goliah, and that
her companion did not require such careful watching,
she took the lead, proceeding through the jungle
about an eighth of a mile to a large banana-grove,
where she began to search for fruit.</p>

<p>Here, as at the village, were the same evidences of
wanton destruction. The long leaves of the plants
were torn and trampled, bunches of half-eaten fruit
lay decaying upon the ground, and that which had
cost no slight amount of both time and money was
almost entirely destroyed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>After some search the chimpanzee succeeded in
finding two clusters of the rich, yellow fruit, and motioning
Philip to pluck them, she pointed toward the
east, as if intimating the direction in which they must
travel.</p>

<p>By this time the shipwrecked youth recognized the
wisdom of his guide’s advice, and staggering under
the heavy load of fruit, he followed close behind
as she left the cultivated ground to re-enter the
jungle.</p>

<p>This detour had evidently been made for the purpose
of providing him with food in such place of
refuge as she was probably about to lead him; and
at that moment the animal-trainer had a higher appreciation
of the intelligence of the monkey-tribe
than ever before.</p>

<p>At a short distance from the banana plantation the
chimpanzee stopped in front of a palm-grove bearing
smooth, shining fruit of a golden-orange color, which
was very attractive in appearance, and Philip began
to gather such as hung within his reach from the
smaller trees, when, much to his surprise, Alice made
the most violent demonstrations of rage. She held
the delicious-looking apples to her mouth for an instant,
and then, dashing them to the ground, screamed
and chattered volubly. It was several seconds before
the fugitive understood this pantomime; but
when she repeated it two or three times he gained
an inkling of her meaning.</p>

<p>Without question this beautiful fruit was poisonous,
and she had called his attention to the fact that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
he might not at any future time eat what was so
tempting in appearance but deadly in its properties.</p>

<p>A ten minutes’ walk from this spot led them to a
natural grotto in the rocks, the floor of which was
covered with thick moss and the thousand vegetable
productions to be found in Malaysia.</p>

<p>Here her gestures were as expressive as words, and
Philip understood that she was cautioning him to remain
in hiding—probably until her return. She
pointed first to the fruit, secondly to the grotto, and
then back in the direction from which they had
come, taking her departure only when he nodded his
head in token of willingness to obey the mute
injunction.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>




<h2 id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE TREASURE-CAVE.</span></h2>

<p>Philip’s first sensation after being left alone
was one of intense relief. For the time being,
at least, he was safe from pursuit, and had not only
food, but water sufficient to satisfy his wants two or
three days. Whether Alice returned or not he
would be free from hunger or thirst, since to revisit
the banana plantation only a brisk walk of fifteen
minutes was necessary.</p>

<p>After making a hearty meal from the fruit he lay
down, and during the next ten hours was wrapped in
the blissful unconsciousness of sleep.</p>

<p>When he awakened it was nearly sunset. Far
away in the distance could be heard the cries of the
apes, and among them he fancied it was possible to
distinguish Goliah’s hoarse voice. To venture forth
would be both needless and unwise, and he remained
within the grotto, trying in vain to find some amusement
or occupation which would serve to make the
time pass more rapidly.</p>

<p>As a matter of course, in this attempt he was unsuccessful.
There was nothing to be done save to
count the seconds, and it does not require many moments
to weary one of such a useless occupation.</p>

<p>Now he had an opportunity to understand how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
painful may be the attack of insects which in other
quarters of the globe would be considered insignificant.
His hands, face and ankles were completely
covered with painful red blotches, caused by the
bites of tiny flies; and a closer inspection of the
grotto showed him that he was by no means alone.</p>

<p>Now and then could be seen curious little animals,
similar to mice, which ran back and forth, nibbling
at the bananas, his shoes, or anything within reach,
until a movement by him would cause them to hide
in alarm. Every time he overturned a stone or
stick he found snugly ensconced under it formidable
scorpions, with their tails sticking up ready for an
attack or to defend themselves.</p>

<p>It seemed as if every nook and corner of the
grotto was teeming with life in some form of viciousness,
and not until he had cleared a space, six
feet square, from gravel and the litter which would
usually be found in such a place could he lie down
with any chance of being unmolested.</p>

<p>There was plenty of time for reflection—too
much, in fact, for his own good; and after making
the wildest conjectures as to the probable fate of
Captain Seaworth and his party, Philip began to
speculate upon the probable length of his voluntary
imprisonment. He could see no immediate relief
from the unpleasant occupants of the island,
and the longer his mind dwelt upon the subject the
more convinced did he become that some desperate
effort to escape must be made.</p>

<p>Then came the important question of where he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
should flee. It was hardly probable there were
other human beings on the island, otherwise they
would have driven the apes from the cottages
erected by the Seaworth party; and to leave this
place of refuge, where he was reasonably sure of
receiving food from the chimpanzee, would be to
call down upon himself a repetition of the unpleasant
and painful events which he had already experienced.</p>

<p>The night was very far advanced before his mind
was sufficiently calm to permit of his sleeping once
more; but slumber did finally visit his eyelids,
bringing in its train most disagreeable dreams, from
which he was glad to be awakened before the sun
had again illumined this tiny portion of the world.</p>

<p>With absolutely nothing save painful thoughts to
occupy his attention, he began in a listless manner
to examine more closely his place of refuge.</p>

<p>As has been said, it was a natural grotto formed
in the rocks, but apparently extending some distance
into the range of hills which stretched nearly across
the island. The rear portion narrowed down to
what seemed to be a tunnel hardly more than four
feet in diameter. In this Philip entered without hesitation,
crawling upon his hands and knees for a distance
of about a hundred feet, during which the
passage grew more and more contracted, until to
turn around would have been absolutely impossible.</p>

<p>At the end of such distance was an abrupt angle,
after which it was possible for him to proceed in a
half-bent attitude along the tunnel, which was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
floored with sand, and obstructed here and there by
boulders or irregular blocks of what appeared to be
limestone.</p>

<p>Perhaps he had walked in this second direction
two hundred feet, when, on turning a second angle,
he stood in an oval-shaped chamber about twenty
yards wide, twice as long, and twenty-five feet high.</p>

<p>It was a marvelous scene which met his startled
gaze. Those who have entered natural caves may
have seen a similar picture, but certainly nothing
more imposing.</p>

<p>In the center of this subterranean cavern was a
small circular lake, hardly more than twelve feet in
diameter, and sunken half a dozen inches from the
level of a floor formed of blackish-gray sand, covered
with small pebbles of various brilliant colors.
The ceiling towered high above, and was dome-shaped,
thickly-studded with pendant stalactites, as
if Nature had thus given to the artisan the first
idea of lincrusta work. On the right, or eastern
side, were benches of rocks rising like terraces,
bearing huge stalagmites shaped like animals, and
incrusted with myriads of tiny crystals which glistened
like diamonds in the light admitted through an
opening partially obscured by the foliage in the center
of the dome.</p>

<p>After standing silent and motionless several moments,
lost in admiration of the scene before him,
Philip pushed on toward another tunnel which led
from the chamber directly opposite the one he had
just traversed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>Here, after five minutes of leisurely walking, the air
became warmer and humid, as if filled with steam,
while on the left side of the tunnel was a stream of
water from which arose a peculiar phosphorescent
light which permitted the amazed traveler to see
several inches below the surface.</p>

<p>A closer examination revealed the fact that the
stream was filled with fish, shaped something like a
trout, and, singular as it may seem, the luminous
glow was emitted from their bodies. He plunged
his hand in without alarming the finny tribe, and
lifting one out discovered that it was blind, having
no sign of an eye, which accounted for the readiness
with which he had made the capture.</p>

<p>Curiosity impelled Philip to continue his explorations
without delay, and he advanced rapidly along
the tunnel, in which it was now possible to stand
erect. With every step the air grew warmer, until
it was as if one were suddenly plunged in a steam
bath.</p>

<p>The cause of this excessive humidity was soon
learned. In one corner of a second chamber was a
boiling spring, which bubbled and hissed just below
the surface of the floor.</p>

<p>He dipped his hand in, but immediately withdrew
it as he gave vent to a cry of pain. The water was
boiling hot!</p>

<p>This cavern also had an exit or outlet about forty
feet long, which opened into a third, nearly twice as
large as the first. From the roof hung hundreds of
stalactites, some only a few feet in length and others<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
which descended to the floor. Stalagmites glittered
and glistened like immense diamonds in a strong
phosphorescent light, until the radiations and reflections
lent such an indescribable charm to the cave
that it seemed as if one were living through a story
from the “Arabian Nights.” This third room was
evidently the end of the chain of caverns. In it
there was no opening, yet the glow from the middle
apartment filled it with light.</p>

<p>Wandering from one point to another without
thought of weariness because of the many wondrous
beauties, Philip soon began to realize the fact that he
was hungry, and when on the point of retreating to
the grotto where the bananas were, he bethought
himself of the trout. To boil two or three in this
kettle formed by nature would be comparatively an
easy task, and at the same time give him a change of
diet.</p>

<p>Passing rapidly on to the stream where he had
seen the fish, he caught and dressed four, fastening
them together with a strip torn from his handkerchief.
Returning to the spring he lowered them, and
in a few moments had sufficient and appetizing food
for a hearty meal. Although eaten without salt, this
change in his bill of fare was a welcome one, and
Philip resolved to take with him a supply of cooked
fish large enough to satisfy his wants during several
days.</p>

<p>To this end he groped about once more on the bed
of the stream until his hand came in contact with a
very heavy round substance, which, simply through
idle curiosity, he raised to the surface.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>His astonishment can hardly be described when he
discovered that the supposed rock was apparently a
nugget of pure gold, weighing, as nearly as he could
judge, from three to four pounds.</p>

<p>The sight of this wealth, which was also evidence
that more might be found in the vicinity, so bewildered
him that it was several moments before he
could make further examinations, and then came the
fever for riches which has been at the same time the
destruction and delight of thousands.</p>

<p>Working with desperate energy, as if the unlimited
time at his disposal was all too short for the purpose,
he brought up nugget after nugget, ranging in size
from an ounce to half a pound, until he had collected
at least ten pounds’ weight of the precious metal.</p>

<p>The supply appeared to be inexhaustible. As
nearly as he could judge, the bed of the stream was
literally covered with these yellow lumps, which represented
wealth in any civilized country; and his
labor ceased only when he began to realize how impossible,
under the present circumstances, it would
be to derive any benefit from this unexpected discovery.</p>

<p>Now, more than ever, was it necessary he should
devise some means of finding his fellow-man, even
though it should be impossible to carry his treasure
away. With a vessel and a crew such as could be
procured at Batavia untold wealth might be taken
away; but how the first step was to be made he had
no idea.</p>

<p>In order to give himself time for reflection he first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
hid the nuggets behind one of the statue-like formations
in the outer chamber, and then returned to the
grotto.</p>

<p>Here he found the chimpanzee looking disturbed
and alarmed because of his absence, but she gave
way to manifestations of the greatest delight at his
appearance. With an instinct which seemed almost
like human intelligence she had brought more
bananas, and by gestures which were unmistakable
gave him to understand that as yet it was dangerous
to leave his hiding-place.</p>

<p>Then, after fawning upon him like a dog once
more, she walked slowly away in the direction of the
village, turning from time to time, as if to be certain
he would not follow.</p>

<p>When finally the animal was lost to view amid the
foliage, Philip retreated to the further end of the
grotto as if desirous of guarding the entrance to the
treasure-cave, and there gave himself up to speculations
regarding his flight from the island, forming
some plans which were hardly more than wild
dreams, and others possible of execution.</p>

<p>The desire to learn the fate of Captain Seaworth
and his party was almost forgotten in his eagerness
to profit by the rich discovery, and during the remainder
of that day the only thought in his mind
was how to leave the island, taking with him at least
a portion of the newly-found wealth.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.<br />
<span class="smaller">TREASURE-GATHERING.</span></h2>

<p>Although Philip was in a situation where
gold was of far less value than food, or even
raiment, that thirst for wealth which has come upon
so many even under similar circumstances became so
great as to create a most intense desire to pile up the
largest possible quantity of the precious but—to
him—useless metal.</p>

<p>Until a late hour in the night he gathered nuggets
from the bed of the stream, being able to work as
well in the under-ground chamber during the time of
darkness as any other, owing to the phosphorescent
light from the fish, until he had hidden behind the
natural statue a weight sufficient to burden half a
dozen men in the carrying. Upon the rough calculation
that twenty-five thousand dollars in gold
weighs a hundred pounds, he had good reason to believe
that the value of his treasure was considerably
more than a hundred thousand dollars.</p>

<p>It was only his desire for sleep which caused him
to desist; and returning once more to the grotto,
after a meal of boiled fish he laid himself down to
sleep, not awakening until daybreak, when, from the
mouth of the hill-side cave, he saw what aroused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
again in his mind the belief that other human beings
beside himself were upon the island.</p>

<p>The reflection of flames could be seen through the
forest, evidently caused by an enormous bonfire, and
the only reasonable supposition was that shipwrecked
mariners were sending out this beacon-light in the
hope of attracting attention from those on some passing
ship. Perhaps more than he had been saved from
the Swallow, and with this thought he darted forward
at full speed, heeding not possible discovery by
the apes in his eagerness to be again with human
companions.</p>

<p>If such a thing were possible, he was more anxious
now than ever before to meet with men, for unless
assistance could be obtained his wealth was useless;
and regardless of the thorns which pierced his flesh,
or of the pitfalls that might be in his path, he ran
swiftly on toward the more than welcome light.</p>

<p>The nearer he approached to the flames the
stronger his hopes grew, for he could see beyond a
peradventure that it was a bonfire on the highest
point of the island, where people signaling for assistance
would naturally build a beacon.</p>

<p>That an enormous quantity of fuel was being consumed
could be told from the fact that it required
nearly an hour of rapid walking before he arrived
at the base of the elevation; and in the highest state
of excitement he ran up the rocky slope, the soil
rattling and crumbling under his feet with such a
peculiar sound that it was reasonable to suppose he
was traveling over the lava of an extinct volcano.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>Here he came upon a kind of vegetation through
which it was absolutely impossible to pass. Occupying
a space of a hundred feet square, as nearly as
he could judge, was a veritable jungle of thorns
across which fifty men with the best of tools would
have been many hours in making a road.</p>

<p>The bushes, the creepers, and even the bamboos
were covered with these long, needle-like points,
which tore his flesh cruelly. Everything grew zig-zag
and jagged, and in an inextricable tangle. To
get through without lacerating his body to such an
extent as to be in danger of death was out of the
question, and in order to reach the desired spot a
long detour was necessary.</p>

<p>When within two-thirds of the distance to the
summit a most extraordinary spectacle greeted him.
Instead of human beings it was apes who had
kindled the fire, and were most industriously engaged
in feeding it.</p>

<p>Two files, composed of over a hundred of these
animals, stretched from the top of the hill down the
side as far as he could see, a distance of about six
feet separating one from the other. This party was
passing fragments of wood, branches of trees, and
such combustible materials, up the incline to those
at the top, who threw the fuel into the flames.</p>

<p>Industrious laborers were they, indeed. Not a
sound could be heard, and with the utmost gravity
they continued the task as if it was something upon
which their lives depended.</p>

<p>Philip now saw that he was upon the crest of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
small volcano which had evidently not been in a
state of eruption for some time, and the fire was
built within the blackened crater, with so much fuel
that it more than filled the space, the glowing coals
rising several feet above the summit.</p>

<p>Unquestionably it was the reflection of a fire similar
to this which he had previously seen; but why
these animals, who are supposed to fear anything of
the kind, worked so hard to keep the blaze alive was
something he could not even imagine. The wood
literally flew through the air, so eager were the
laborers to see the flames leap and dance in the gray
light of the morning; and it was with a certain fascination,
similar to that experienced while viewing
the proceedings of the court a few days before, that
Philip gazed upon the scene.</p>

<p>It could not have been more than five minutes
that he remained motionless watching these strange
proceedings, and just when he began to realize how
necessary it was to leave the place before being discovered
the apes caught sight of him.</p>

<p>In an instant, as if by magic, the silence was
broken. A dozen of the animals clustered around
him, shouting and screaming as if to others in the
distance, until the din was almost deafening, and he
could hear it echoed and re-echoed far away in the
distance. His first thought was to make his escape,
by force if necessary; but before he could even so
much as raise his hands two gigantic baboons leaped
toward him and seized, firmly but not roughly, both
his arms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>Either one of the animals could have held him
prisoner despite his most violent resistance, and
Philip realized full well the uselessness of a struggle
in which he would inevitably receive many
severe blows, even if he should be so fortunate as
to escape death.</p>

<p>During fifteen minutes the screaming and yelling
continued, his captors holding him immovable all
the while; and then, as if a summons had been received
from some one in authority, the two baboons
led him down the hill, followed by all those who
had been working so energetically to feed the flames.</p>

<p>Through the forest in the direction by which he
had approached, past the banana plantation to the
single street of the tiny settlement, Philip was led
like a malefactor, with the long train of grinning,
chattering followers; and he had good reason to believe
his fate might be the same as that of the
skeleton which he had seen hanging in the thicket
of mimosas. He knew beyond a peradventure that
he was being conducted to the presence of Goliah,
and who could say what the vindictive baboon might
devise in the way of punishment for the one who
had not, in his case at least, been a gentle master.</p>

<p>Goliah would remember all that had occurred, as
could be told from the imprisonment of Ben Bolt
and the behavior of Alice; therefore the merchant
who had come so far in search of living curiosities
knew there was good cause for alarm regarding this
meeting.</p>

<p>Upon reaching the village the baboons led their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
prisoner to the most pretentious of the little cottages,
which had probably been occupied by Captain
Seaworth as the office or counting-house of the
colony, and into this he was thrust. His two captors
were the only members of the party who accompanied
him. The others remained in the street,
some sitting on their haunches, as if speculating
whether they were to be treated to the spectacle of
an execution, a few hanging on the broken fences
like boys who loiter in front of a residence at which
distinguished personages are visiting, and the majority
of the crowd surrounding the building much as
though taking steps to prevent an escape.</p>

<p>The interior of the dwelling differed but little
from the outside, so far as the scene of wanton destruction
was concerned. Books were thrown from
their cases, leaves torn, and the bindings ruthlessly
pulled off. Fragments of clothing were strewn on
the floor, furniture scratched and splintered, and
pictures turned face to the wall or thrown among
the debris in one corner of the room. Everything
gave token of the mischievousness of these animals;
and yet in the midst of all a certain kind of order
reigned, as if the long-tailed residents were bent on
preserving some semblance of what the interior had
once presented.</p>

<p>All these things Philip took in at a glance. He
had no time to study details, for within a very few
seconds a most singular and grotesque figure made
its appearance from an adjoining room.</p>

<p>One would have said it was a gigantic bird, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
Philip immediately recognized the face as Goliah’s;
and the sight of this ape, covered from head to foot
with feathers, naturally filled the prisoner with the
greatest surprise.</p>

<p>The cause of this strange transformation, however,
was soon revealed. The feathers were simply
quills, the majority of which had been made into
pens, and were stuck over his ears, through the hair
on the top of his head, under his arms, and in every
place where one would remain, not even excepting
the extreme end of his tail.</p>

<p>Goliah was followed by two smaller and less ferocious-looking
baboons, who were decorated in the
same fantastic manner, and from their attitude one
might readily fancy they occupied the position of
servants, or perhaps counselors to his apish majesty.</p>

<p>The sight of this animal, whom he had chastised
so many times, caused Philip no slight alarm, for
there was good reason to believe that some signal
vengeance might be wreaked upon him, and he
peered closely into the hairy, feather-bedecked face
to learn whether his identity was discovered.</p>

<p>If Goliah recognized his old master he gave no
sign of such fact, probably because he had more important
business on hand just at that moment. He
stopped only long enough to glance at the frightened
youth, and then, consulting for an instant with
the two behind him, uttered several sharp cries,
which were evidently commands. Immediately
Philip’s captors led him into an adjoining room,
where was such a scene as would have convinced the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
most skeptical that the monkey-tribe can be trained
to become useful in many ways.</p>

<p>In this apartment were at least fifty apes seated
at two long tables, and all in a state of the most intense
excitement. They had before them large
quantities of paper, huge bottles of ink, and a numerous
collection of quill-pens, which they were using
with the same industry and energy as shown by the
feeders of the fire. They leaned over the table like
weary clerks, dipping their pens into the inkstands
frequently, often mistaking their paws for the quills
in the general hurry and confusion, and scribbling
upon sheets of paper spread before them, as if trying
to imitate, with the greatest possible fidelity, a
party of overworked journalists.</p>

<p>With their quills, or fingers, they scratched incessantly,
spattering ink in every direction, and sheet
after sheet was covered with what looked not unlike
a stenographer’s notes.</p>

<p>When the paper was sufficiently bespattered with
ink it was passed to a venerable old monkey, who
occupied a single desk at the further end of the
room, and he, after examining it intently, affixed
one of those little, red-paper seals which are used on
legal documents. Then it was handed to a monkey
stationed just outside the door, and by him passed
along a line, precisely as the wood at the volcano
had been, save that, so far as Philip could understand,
the messengers were sent toward the sea-coast.</p>

<p>After the lapse of ten or fifteen minutes the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
paper was returned to the house and handed to Goliah,
who, with an air of greatest wisdom, scanned
it carefully. Then he in turn passed it to another
old ape in an adjoining room, who was probably a
register of deeds, a recorder of wills, or whatever
title is bestowed upon the keeper of monkey documents.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>




<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE BABOON TASK-MASTER.</span></h2>

<p>From what he saw in this private counting-room
Philip was convinced that the apes were
trying to imitate scenes which they had witnessed
before the unaccountable dispersion of the colony.</p>

<p>During Captain Seaworth’s stay upon the island,
and while laying out work on the plantations, he
most likely had occasion to transmit many written
messages to his assistants, who were probably scattered
over a considerable extent of territory; therefore
Goliah and his companions must have seen very
often that which they were portraying so grotesquely.</p>

<p>The big baboon, either from a desire to see the
greatest possible number of servants at work or
because the dispatches were not brought back fast
enough to occupy all his time, had apparently decided
to make Philip his chief clerk, for he gave orders—or
so the prisoner supposed, from the cries
which were uttered—and one of the scribblers vacated
his seat at the table. To this the animal-trainer
was led. A package of paper and several
quill-pens were placed before him, and from the expressive
gestures indulged in by all the party there
could be no question but that he was commanded to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
cover the blank sheets with something which had a
semblance to writing.</p>

<p>Philip was not in a position to rebel. In fact,
this treatment was so different from what he had
expected that he felt an intense relief at learning
the punishment was to be so slight. Before being
allowed to cease work, however, he had good proof
that his life was to be quite the reverse of an easy
one.</p>

<p>During the first hour he worked with reasonable
industry, cheered by the hope that in so doing he
might, through some unlooked-for chance, bring
human beings to his aid. In bold, legible handwriting
he covered each sheet with this brief appeal
for assistance:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Philip Garland, a merchant from New York,
shipwrecked on this island, is held captive by a large
troop of apes, who have taken possession of cottages
erected by Captain Seaworth. Should this, by
chance, fall into the hands of his countrymen, they
are asked in the name of mercy and humanity to
aid him in escaping.</p></div>

<p>There was a bare possibility that some of these
documents might be lost by the messengers and
found by those who would try to aid him. Improbable
though such a contingency was, it served to
cheer him at his work, and Goliah appeared pleased
because of the rapidity with which the sheets were
returned.</p>

<p>When an hour had passed, however, he not only
grew weary, but dispirited, and would have stopped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
had not two apes, who were stationed directly behind
his chair evidently by the big baboon’s orders,
signified in the most emphatic manner that he was
to continue the work. One boxed his ears soundly,
while the other pointed toward the paper with harsh
cries, which were echoed by Goliah in a more commanding
tone.</p>

<p>There was to be no cessation in this dispatch-writing,
and with a groan Philip resumed his labors, only
to be subjected to the most violent usage whenever
he faltered in the task.</p>

<p>The day passed with the animal-trainer still at the
table, his head aching and his fingers cramped so that
he could hardly hold the pen. He had long since
ceased to write appeals for help, but covered the
paper with any kind of marks made at random.
Twice during the afternoon he ceased his labors because
of sheer weariness, and on both occasions not
only the two apes behind his chair, but all their companions
in the room, pinched his arms, pulled his hair,
struck heavy blows on his head, or scratched his face
with their sharp claws.</p>

<p>Night came, and although it was not possible for
him to see the marks left by the pen, his guards kept
vigilant watch, forcing him by the most severe
punishment to continue until the light of another
dawn illumined the room wherein half a hundred
vindictive animals watched for the least sign of
faltering on the part of their unhappy prisoner.</p>

<p>It was when he believed it would be absolutely
impossible to hold the quill between his nerveless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
fingers another moment that the sound of a bell
from some remote portion of the building caused
every ape to leave the room, and Philip staggered to
his feet like one on the verge of exhaustion.</p>

<p>During these twenty-four hours he had blackened
many quires of paper, and each sheet had passed
from one ape to another, probably making half the
circuit of the island before it was returned to Goliah.
But now his labors were ended for the time being, at
least, and he ran down the stairs as if thinking this
bell summoned him to the breakfast he so ardently
desired.</p>

<p>The two sentinels behind his chair had not ceased
their duties of overseers, but in Goliah’s absence it
was evident they did not dare to restrain his movements;
and thus, comparatively free in a dwelling
filled with brute enemies, he was allowed to proceed
unmolested until he arrived at the veranda in the
rear of the building, where an old ape was tugging
vigorously at a bell attached to a post.</p>

<p>This veranda led into what might be called a court-yard,
around each side of which were long, low
buildings, probably used as sleeping-apartments for
Captain Seaworth’s crew and clerks. The yard was
covered with an awning, and in the center had been
built a small pond, bordered with the tropical plants
which grew in such profusion on the island. Here
and there a banana-tree upreared its glossy leaves,
and at irregular intervals smooth trunks of the
bamboo thrust their delicate foliage through apertures
made in the awning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>It was a place where wearied workers might seek
rest from their toil, and undoubtedly Captain Seaworth
had caused it to be so arranged for his own
especial enjoyment.</p>

<p>An air of homeliness at variance with what Philip
had already witnessed was presented in the person
of an old monkey seated near the shore of the miniature
pond holding her baby, while she watched, with
all the care and considerably more than the tenderness
of our imported French nurses, over several
little monkeys who were not yet old enough to run
about alone.</p>

<p>Such was the view from the veranda looking into
the court-yard. Gazing in the opposite direction,
however, a less interesting spectacle was presented.
Philip was standing just outside of what had evidently
served as Captain Seaworth’s dining-room.
Here the tables had been spread by the monkey attendants,
or left by the domestics originally employed
in the house, and the scene of disorder may be
imagined. Plates were scattered about in every
direction—on the floor, the chairs and the window-sills.
Broken glassware and crockery rendered
walking dangerous unless one’s feet were well protected.
Knives, forks, spoons, tumblers, bottles and
fragments of food were strewn over the room in the
greatest profusion.</p>

<p>Amid all this disorder, even as Philip stood gazing
about with surprise and dismay written on his face,
Goliah strutted into the room and seated himself in
the very middle of the table, while his immediate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
following clustered around him, some on the floor,
others on chairs, and the two old advisers occupied
either end of the festive-board.</p>

<p>Philip’s hunger was too great to admit of his being
fastidious. None of the monkey-guests appeared to
pay any particular attention to him, and he entered
in the hope of finding food which was yet in a condition
to be at least palatable.</p>

<p>All evidence of the cook’s skill, however, had long
since been devoured or destroyed. The apes were
eating raw vegetables, corn and leaves. The leaders
of the party were feasting on a peculiar bark which
had been freshly stripped from the trees, and was
evidently considered as a choice morsel. They were
by no means averse to their human servant partaking
of the delicacy, and were even painfully hospitable,
acting on their usual rule of all engaging in the
same occupation at the same time.</p>

<p>Several gathered around Philip, and with manners
more forcible than polite thrust into his mouth pieces
of the bark, vegetables which resembled yams, and
even going so far, in their eagerness, as to push two
or three pieces of crockery between his teeth. In
order to make certain that he was getting his full
share, one venerable monkey held his mouth open
that the others might more quickly satisfy his
hunger, and it required very violent exertions on his
part to prevent being choked to death.</p>

<p>Fortunately for him, before the entire party could
indulge in this alleged hospitable work a number of
apes entered the room bearing large quantities of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
the favorite bark, and a frantic rush was made by
all the feasters, which resulted in his being neglected
for the moment.</p>

<p>To satisfy his hunger with the articles of food
here in the dining-room was impossible, while to
remain might be to subject himself to a diet of
crockery and glassware; therefore, at a moment
when he fancied himself unnoticed, he stole softly
out of the window into the court-yard, and continued
on to the further end, where was a sign over
one of the doors bearing the word “Kitchen.”</p>

<p>Not alone did he go, however, for the counselors
on the table seeing his departure ran quickly after
him, and in a twinkling every occupant of the dining-room
was at his heels—not for the purpose of
restraining his movements, but to learn what would
be done.</p>

<p>To avoid this unpleasant retinue, if possible, he
darted into an apartment midway between the
kitchen and the veranda, which was evidently
Captain Seaworth’s sitting-room. Here the work of
destruction had not been so complete. Several
chairs were yet in serviceable condition, while a
violin, two guitars and a banjo hung on the walls
with no marks of having been touched by the long-tailed
invaders.</p>

<p>Philip did not delay in this room, however, since
food was the one object of his desires, and he passed
through several apartments until the kitchen was
finally reached.</p>

<p>To this place the instincts of the apes were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
sufficient to give them free access. The doors of the
cupboards were yet closed, for the invaders had not
been able to unfasten the catches. The marks of
their vain attempts in this direction, however, were
written plainly in long scratches across the doors, as
if they had been seeking for some secret spring,
overlooking entirely the buttons and bolts.</p>

<p>Every member of the party from the dining-room
was close at his heels when he opened the first of
the cupboards and found it filled with all kinds of
canned meats, poultry, vegetables, sardines, jam,
milk, and other delicacies which were probably intended
for the officers of the expedition.</p>

<p>The most conspicuous article in the closet was a
huge jar of preserved ginger which had most likely
been taken on board during the latter portion of the
voyage, and this immediately attracted Goliah’s
attention. The lid was partially off, and with one
blow of his paw he dislodged it entirely, thrusting
his head into the jar up to the shoulders.</p>

<p>His followers, envious of his good fortune, and not
being able to procure for themselves anything from
this newly-discovered hoard because of the narrowness
of the door, seized their leader by the tail, pulling
him from one side of the room to the other
regardless of his efforts to remain quiet long enough
to enjoy the unexpected feast.</p>

<p>As a matter of course the baboon was dragged
over no inconsiderable space; but he managed to
keep his head within the neck of the jar, and his
zealous subjects only succeeded in rolling both him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
and the sweetmeats about, his hairy shoulders completely
filling the mouth of the vessel so that none
of the contents were spilled.</p>

<p>Philip was entirely neglected during this strife in
which every member of the brute company took
part, and it was evident the struggle would be ended
only when Goliah’s tail was pulled out, the jar
broken, or his head removed from its sweet resting-place.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>




<h2 id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV.<br />
<span class="smaller">A MONKEY-FEAST.</span></h2>

<p>During five minutes Philip watched the
struggle between Goliah and his subjects with
no slight amusement. The baboon’s long tail made
an excellent handle, and by the aid of it the apes
swung him around and around, with the jar still covering
his head, in what was at the same time a most
laughable and dangerous manner.</p>

<p>It would have been possible for the baboon to
release himself at any moment by loosening his hold
of the jar; but the dainties to be found therein
were too enticing to be relinquished so readily, and
without protest he allowed himself to be flung from
one side of the room to the other, he eating greedily
all the while.</p>

<p>This struggle was not confined to the baboon and
those who were swinging him around in such a
lively fashion. It was only possible for half a dozen
of his followers to grasp the tail, and the others
were not content to remain simply as spectators
when there was a possible opportunity to gorge
themselves. The two old counselors had managed
to seize the jar, but their united efforts were not
sufficient to wrest it from Goliah; yet, having
smeared their fingers with the juice which trickled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
over the leader’s shoulders, both were wildly eager
to gain possession of some portion of the dainty.</p>

<p>Nor were they the only ones possessed with the
same desire. The entire company seemed to have
but one idea, which was to partake of preserved
ginger at the earliest possible moment, and before
five minutes elapsed there was every indication of
an extensive riot. Each ape had begun to struggle
with his neighbor, urged on alike by his love of
sweetmeats and his instincts of imitation.</p>

<p>Now, while Philip would have welcomed the sudden
death of the huge baboon who held him captive,
he was by no means disposed to have the party
engage in deadly combat if it could be avoided.
He knew full well that before the fight had progressed
very far one or more of the company would
seize upon him; and in this encounter, where heads
were pounded against the wall without any regard
to the thickness of skull, he would stand in very
much the same position as did the fragile vase when
the bull made his way into the china-shop.</p>

<p>Unfortunately there was but one jar of preserved
ginger, and although he held out glass after glass of
the jam and other preserves, not a single member of
the party accepted the gift. Each was looking for
a prize of the same size as that in Goliah’s possession,
and nothing smaller would satisfy his ambition.</p>

<p>Then Philip attempted to leave the room, thinking
they might follow, or that he would at least be free;
but this was a movement impossible of execution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
owing to the whirling apes between him and the door,
and any retreat was out of the question because the
closet was too narrow to serve as a place of refuge.</p>

<p>Each second the strife waxed warmer, until it
seemed as if the apartment was filled with monkeys
of all sizes, who were being swung in the air by their
tails; and more than once was Philip knocked down
by the heads or arms of these living missiles.</p>

<p>At the moment when he had given up all hope of
being able to check the wild scramble his eyes
lighted upon a bag of nuts. In a twinkling he
emptied them on the floor, and in an equally short
space of time the confusion ceased as every ape began
to scramble for his share of the fruit.</p>

<p>Goliah was the only one who did not join in this
last scene. When those who had attached themselves
to his tail let go their hold he was flung into
one corner of the room with the jar still pressed
tightly to his shoulders, and there he remained, unheeded
and unheeding, gorging himself with the
sweetmeats until the skin of his stomach was
stretched as tight as the head of a drum.</p>

<p>While the long-tailed company were enjoying this
unwonted feast, and strewing the floor thickly with
nutshells, Philip made all haste to satisfy his hunger.
There were plenty of sardines in the way of solid
food, and these, with ship’s-biscuit, made a reasonably
hearty meal, which he ate standing half in the
cupboard, lest his companions should suddenly become
possessed of the idea to indulge in these oily
delicacies also.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>During this time, and before the other feasters had
exhausted the supply of nuts, he held the closet-door
only partially open, determined to shut and lock it
when his hunger was appeased, for he knew full well
it would be but the work of a few seconds for the
apes to clear everything from the shelves if they were
given the opportunity.</p>

<p>But it was while taking the greatest precautions
that he was in reality the most careless.</p>

<p>Having eaten enough he desired to quench his
thirst, and to that end had broken the top from a bottle
of wine, there being many cases in the cupboard.
In the absence of a glass he was forced to use the
bottle as a drinking-vessel, and to do so it was
necessary to raise it above his head. He was thus
obliged to turn partially around, forgetting the fact
that he was exhibiting himself to the company.</p>

<p>Before his thirst was assuaged he had painful evidence
of his indiscretion. In the twinkling of an
eye every ape ceased cracking nuts and leaped
toward the closet, while Philip, taken thus by surprise,
had not time to shut the door. As a matter of
course all the party could not come within reach of
the cupboard at the same moment, but those in advance
passed the wine-bottles to their companions in
the rear until every monkey had enough of this unusual
beverage to make him tipsy in short order.</p>

<p>As soon as possible Philip shut the cupboard-door;
but it was a case of “locking the stable after the
horse had been stolen,” and he looked around with
dismay as he saw each of his long-tailed companions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
holding a bottle to his mouth, evidently wondering
how the stupid man could have found so much satisfaction
in what was to them very dry fun.</p>

<p>The fact that they did not know enough to draw
the corks caused him to hope none of the party would
succeed in getting any liquor; but in this he was
speedily disappointed.</p>

<p>It was one of Goliah’s advisers who, after watching
Philip stealthily, had begun the rush for the bottles,
and this old fellow knew exactly how their
prisoner had set about extracting the contents.</p>

<p>The aged ape struck off the head of the bottle with
a potato-masher which was on the table, and five
minutes later the floor was strewn with broken glass,
while every animal in the room except Goliah was
busily engaged in making himself more brutish than
nature intended.</p>

<p>Philip stood gazing at this apparently convivial
company with dismay written on every feature of
his countenance. If sober apes were disagreeable
companions, what would be the result when he was
surrounded by three or four hundred drunken animals?
There could be no question but that they
would be intoxicated when each had finished his
bottle, and then the position of the captive, already
disagreeable, must necessarily be increased a hundred-fold.</p>

<p>It was probably the silence of the feasters which
aroused Goliah from his ginger-dream. He withdrew
his head, plentifully besmeared with the saccharine
liquid, to gaze stupidly about him, while pieces of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
preserves hung from his nose, ears and eyebrows in
the most picturesque fashion. Gorged though he
was, the sweet repast did not suffice when his
followers had something different, and with one
bound he leaped upon the smallest monkey-toper.
To choke the astonished little reveler and wrest his
bottle from him was but the work of a moment, and
then the king of the island began his vinous portion
of the feast.</p>

<p>Now, as if he had not already done himself sufficient
injury, Philip speedily set the example of a yet
more alarming phase in this monkey orgy.</p>

<p>Angry because of what he had unwittingly done
he dashed his empty bottle against the cupboard-door.</p>

<p>This example was contagious. In another instant
every ape was busily engaged in belaboring his companions
with bottles, and fragments of glass flew
in all directions.</p>

<p>Now, more than ever, was it difficult to leave the
apartment. The hailstorm of glass was so thick
as almost to obscure the vision, and Philip crouched
behind the cooking-stove to protect himself from
the flying particles.</p>

<p>Two seconds later a groan of horror burst from
his lips, for every one of the half-drunken monkeys
immediately conceived it necessary to do the same
thing, and he was undermost in the living stack,
each member of which continued to beat the other
with such fragments of glass as had survived the
first onslaught.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>It seemed certain he would be crushed to death—crushed
between two or three hundred quarts of
wine encased in apes’ skins, and each of these animated
bottles writhing, twisting and scratching to
get undermost.</p>

<p>It was fully fifteen minutes before Philip could so
far extricate himself as to be able once more to divert
the attention of the party, and then he seized
the first possible means of deliverance. Wresting a
half-shattered bottle from the clutch of the nearest
ape, he threw it toward the window, and, as a
natural consequence, every monkey about him struggled
to his feet that he might repeat the movement.</p>

<p>While this afforded him some slight relief, it was
decidedly a dangerous experiment. The wine had
begun its work, and the apes were now so thoroughly
intoxicated as to have no idea of direction.</p>

<p>Instead of hurling the sharp fragments through
the window, as Philip intended they should, the
long-tailed drunkards threw them at the doors, the
stove, or their companions, until one would have
thought himself in a fierce storm, where hail-stones
were replaced by glass.</p>

<p>To remain upright without great danger of being
seriously wounded, if not killed, was impossible, and
he who had begun this last and most dangerous
amusement was forced to throw himself on the
floor to avoid the flying particles.</p>

<p>Again did he witness another painful proof of an
ape’s power of imitation. In a twinkling every animal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
in the room threw himself on the floor, and
once more did Philip find himself the “under dog
in the fight.”</p>

<p>He was wounded in numberless places from the
claws of his companions or the fragments of glass,
and yet, whether he arose or remained passive, there
was still the sad satisfaction of knowing that it was
he, and he alone, who set the fashion in this kingdom
of apes.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>




<h2 id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI.<br />
<span class="smaller">AN APISH ORGY.</span></h2>

<p>It required ten minutes of difficult work before
Philip could succeed in leaving the room
where he had thoughtlessly done so much mischief,
and then, with all the drunken apes close at his heels,
he ran into the court-yard and threw himself on the
bank of the tiny stream, so thoroughly disheartened
as to be careless of what further trouble might
come.</p>

<p>The scene which was presented under the awning
during the next half-hour would have given a disinterested
spectator no slight amount of amusement,
but in Philip’s eyes it was too painful to admit of
even a smile.</p>

<p>The party were seated as near the border of the
pond as possible, and to have some idea of the picture
the reader should multiply any grossly intoxicated
person he has seen by about four hundred;
but even then, and with the most vivid imagination,
he could hardly do full justice to the spectacle.</p>

<p>They leered at each other, called names in the
monkey language, very likely told improbable
stories, and argued after the fashion of men. Here
and there a party of a dozen were raising their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
voices in discordant notes, which was not unlike the
maudlin singing of human beings. Now and then
one would stagger back and forth in a vain attempt
to get nearer the pond, while his companions did all
in their power to keep him back. Then an ape,
catching a glimpse of his own tail, and believing
that it belonged to his neighbor, would seize and
pull it until he literally overturned himself. If in
falling he struck any other member of the party, an
incipient riot was started, but not to continue very
long, owing to the inebriated condition of all.</p>

<p>Those nearest the prisoner overwhelmed him with
rough caresses, which at times threatened to leave
him entirely bald, because of the desire to show
affection by examining each particular hair on his
head. If they had understood the custom and significance
of hand-shaking, the animal-trainer’s
troubles would have been much greater; but as it
was, he had even more in the way of trials than
could be borne with any respectable show of
equanimity.</p>

<p>Taking the scene as a whole, and knowing exactly
how these disagreeable companions had been made
more brutish than was natural, it presented such a
lesson as Philip must have profited by, for one cannot
see even drunken men without realizing the
beauties and benefits of temperance.</p>

<p>To move ever so slightly was to find the others
doing the same thing, and Philip waited patiently
throughout the whole of that long, dreary day,
hoping his companions would soon be wrapped in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
slumber, when he might make his escape to the
grotto.</p>

<p>But he waited in vain. At intervals certain members
of the party would doze; but there was no
moment when more than fifty were in a state even
approaching unconsciousness, although the entire
troop grew more quiet, if not more sober, when the
shadows of night began to gather.</p>

<p>Probably no man ever so desired to escape observation
as did Philip, when, just after sunset, he arose
cautiously and made his way toward the kitchen in
the hope of being able to penetrate that portion
of the house, where he might find some degree
of privacy. Surely, there should be a small
apartment in which he could barricade himself, and
it was with this in his mind that he entered the
building.</p>

<p>Here, however, the gloom was already filling the
room—for night in the tropics comes on very rapidly—rendering
some artificial light necessary.
With every reason to believe there might be lamps
or candles in the cupboard he opened the door once
more, closing it very suddenly as the entire body of
apes rushed in, ready for any further mischief which
might present itself.</p>

<p>Philip stood for an instant with his back to the
closet, wondering if it would be safe to make any
investigations while his companions were so near,
and as he faced the party it was impossible to check
his mirth despite all the reasons he had for sorrow.</p>

<p>The monkey-topers, now partially recovered from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
the effects of the wine, were looking thoroughly
demoralized and repentant. Some were holding
their paws to their heads as if to check the pain,
while others appeared to be suffering most in the
region of the stomach. The majority of the party
yet walked unsteadily, and at short intervals squads
of from ten to twenty would return to the pond in
order to quench the unnatural thirst which was
causing them to feel very wretched.</p>

<p>Under such a condition of affairs Philip believed
that his followers were incapable of any serious mischief,
and, holding the cupboard door only partially
open, he reached inside for the purpose of providing
himself with a light.</p>

<p>Again chance aided, and the apes outwitted him.
His hand struck the lid of a box, and, displacing
the cover, he found that it was filled with candles,
while piled in one corner immediately behind it was
a quantity of matches.</p>

<p>Now it became necessary to use both hands, and
with one he extracted a candle from the box, while
with the other he ignited the wick.</p>

<p>This movement necessarily prevented him from
retaining his hold on the cupboard-door, and the
half-sobered apes in the rear immediately seized
upon the opportunity. Philip’s candle was but just
lighted when with a rush they dashed into the
closet, and behold! three hundred apes each with
a candle and a package of matches, forming a
cordon around Philip, and making the air heavy
with brimstone as they rubbed the “fire-sticks” on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
the doors, floor, stove, or more than once on their
own hides. As Philip had done so did every ape in
the room, and with the most alarming consequences.
Now and then one less sober than his companions
would ignite a full bunch of matches, much to his
alarm and confusion. As a matter of course, such a
blunderer immediately threw the blazing bits of
wood to the floor, thereby causing the animal-trainer
no slight fear, for it was impossible to say
when the others might not do the same thing.</p>

<p>It seemed as if this was the culmination of all
Philip’s troubles, for to place a match and candle in
the hands of a sober ape is to supply the means of a
conflagration, and what must be the result when
these dangerous things are controlled by intoxicated
brutes?</p>

<p>Philip’s first thought was to extinguish his own
candle; but even while on the point of doing so it
flashed into his mind that by causing the flame to
disappear he might seem to have thrown it away,
and then would ensue a scene similar to the one
with the bottles, making the immediate destruction
of the building inevitable.</p>

<p>It was plain that, having thus far committed himself
to the necessity of artificial light, he must retain
possession of it, and he made great show of holding
it carefully in both hands—a movement which was
at once imitated by the others, but not so cleverly
as would have been the case under other circumstances.</p>

<p>The result of this precaution was that at least one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
ape out of every three burned his paws, while the
other two singed their nearest neighbors until the
odor of burning hair was almost stifling.</p>

<p>Now the room resounded with cries of pain, and
those who had been burned belabored the party
next to them, regardless of whether they had inflicted
the injuries or not, until the entire throng
were flogging each other with these tiny flames,
scattering wicks and tallow in every direction,
while the blazing of hair added to the general
illumination.</p>

<p>Philip realized that something must be done
immediately, and he forced his way out through the
drunken crowd to the court-yard, going from there
to the sitting-room with the intention of gaining the
street.</p>

<p>The door to this last apartment was fastened,
however, and in order to push back the bolts he
placed his candle on the window-sill.</p>

<p>Before five seconds had elapsed every portion of
the room was decorated with lighted candles, and
for the time being all danger of a conflagration was
averted, while the apes themselves gave evidence of
being in some familiar place.</p>

<p>It was probable that Captain Seaworth had given
a party, or sanctioned a gathering of his officers and
the colonists, when the room had been illuminated
after this same fashion, and equally probable that
the apes were spectators, at some time in the past,
of the scene from the outside.</p>

<p>They exchanged glances with each other, chattered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
noisily, and gesticulated vigorously, while
Philip stood gazing at them in amazement, wondering
what new phase of danger he was about to
encounter.</p>

<p>An instant later four or five, whose memory was
better than their companions’, seized upon the
musical instruments which hung on the wall and
began striking the strings with both hands and feet,
while the others, each with a partner, whirled,
leaped and shouted as they went through with the
movements of a dance. One couple would dart up
and down the room, taking about four strides to
cover the entire distance; another set circled around
and around within a circumscribed space; and yet
more stood bowing and scraping, until, had the
scene been presented on the stage of a theater, it
would have called forth the most generous applause.</p>

<p>Every detail of a ball-room was here depicted
after a certain apish fashion, and the fact that at
least half the company wore some portion of clothing
lent a decided air of realism to the scene.</p>

<p>The amateur musicians were most industrious, and
since their idea of perfect harmony was the greatest
possible amount of noise, the result can be imagined.
Their facilities for playing were much greater than
man’s. For instance, a huge ape who had taken one
of the banjos was seated on the floor holding it
with his left foot, while the right and both hands
were used to strike resounding blows on the strings.
The performer on the guitar had pressed into
service a small monkey as assistant, and while the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
latter held the instrument above his head, the
musician used hands and tail with which to draw
forth wild and discordant strains.</p>

<p>Goliah had left the apartment immediately the
dance began, and Philip’s idea was that he had
simply gone to station sentinels around the building
to prevent his escape; therefore he remained in
one corner of the room, hidden as far as possible
from the merry-makers, not daring to show the least
desire to quit the scene of the festivities.</p>

<p>The remainder of the party did not appear to be
at all disturbed by the absence of their leader.
They waltzed, polkaed, bowed and promenaded, chatting
gaily meanwhile; but after half an hour of
this sport the greater number followed the big
baboon’s example, until not more than twenty
couples were left to go through the motions of keeping
time to the discordant braying of the instruments.</p>

<p>If Philip deluded himself with the idea that they
were growing tired, and that he would speedily find
an opportunity of making his escape, he was mistaken.</p>

<p>In less than a quarter of an hour the outer doors
were thrown open with a crash, and the animal-trainer
looked up in astonishment to see entering
the room what at first glance appeared to be a party
of richly-dressed ladies and gentlemen.</p>

<p>There were half a hundred apes wearing muslin,
silk and calico dresses; some with shawls, others
with bonnets, and not a few carrying gloves in their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
hands, all attended by male escort clad in a variety
of costumes.</p>

<p>It was Goliah who led this brilliant party, and leaning
on his arm, but looking terrified, was Sweet Alice,
who had evidently been forced by the baboon to
take part in the merry-making while her mate remained
a prisoner in the cage.</p>

<p>After what Philip had already witnessed there
was no trouble in divining where these costumes had
come from. The memory of a similar scene, when
the colonists had appeared dressed in their best, was
probably so vivid in the minds of the apes that the
houses of the settlement had been immediately ransacked
for a supply of finery.</p>

<p>Had Philip been able to so far disassociate himself
from the painful fact that he was a captive,
and become once more a student of natural history,
he would have received a most interesting lesson regarding
the point where instinct ceases and mental
effort begins.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII.<br />
<span class="smaller">INCONVENIENT MEMORIES.</span></h2>

<p>Up to this time those of the apes who had
once been articles of merchandise in Philip
Garland’s establishment gave no signs of remembering
their past treatment, and he congratulated
himself, even amid his troubles, that they did not
take it into their apish heads to put him through
the same course of training as he formerly practiced.</p>

<p>This lack of memory was only temporary, however,
as he soon had the best of reasons to know,
and never did a man repent more bitterly his attempts
at animal-training than Philip on this eventful
evening, while his long-tailed hosts were indulging
in the gayeties of a ball.</p>

<p>The sport was at its height. The partially-clad
apes were whirling around the room, evidently enjoying
the dance as much as ever their masters and
mistresses did; and Philip stood in one corner, hidden
by the throng, watching for an opportunity to
make his escape through one of the half-opened
windows leading to the front veranda. He believed
the apes had for the time being forgotten him, but
in this he made a sad mistake.</p>

<p>Suddenly a large monkey, who had formed a part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
of the collection sold to Captain Seaworth’s officers,
came close to his old master. Philip recognized him
as one whom he had taught, after much labor and
many blows, to play the banjo, and from the expression
of the animal’s face he understood that further
trouble for himself was near at hand.</p>

<p>The monkey scanned him so long and intently
that half a score of the dancers ceased their sport
and gathered around, full of curiosity to learn what
was to be done with this specimen of the human
tribe.</p>

<p>It was as if the animal had tried to attract the
attention of his comrades. When there was a sufficient
number around to prevent any possibility of
the animal-trainer’s escape, the monkey went to
that portion of the room where one of the banjos
was hanging, and, taking down the instrument,
thrust it into Philip’s hands as he uttered a hoarse
cry in a commanding voice.</p>

<p>At this moment the other members of the company
who had formerly belonged to Philip’s establishment
gathered around in high glee, and there
could be no mistake as to their intentions. As the
animal-trainer had taught his articles of merchandise,
so now they were going to teach him, and the
lesson would unquestionably be painful as well as
humiliating.</p>

<p>For an instant Philip’s pride prevented him from
playing the part of musician to the monkey-dancers,
and he shook his head as if to say it was impossible.
Almost at the same moment he regretted having refused,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
for the monkey immediately struck him across
the face with the instrument, dealing such a blow as
sent the unfortunate captive staggering back against
the wall.</p>

<p>Again was the punishment about to be repeated,
but before the blow could be delivered Philip suddenly
remembered how to play, and, swallowing his
pride as best he could, took the banjo, running his
fingers lightly across the strings.</p>

<p>At this new phase in the game of monkey-turned-trainer
Goliah joined the party, and his memory
proved to be even more perfect than that of the
others.</p>

<p>It had been Philip’s greatest achievement in the
education of these animals to form a trio, each ape
performing on a different instrument; and in order
that the picture should be correct, Goliah called two
of those who were playing for the dancers to range
themselves on either side of his late master.</p>

<p>Thus behold the youth whose proudest boast had
been that he could train any animal, however ferocious,
seated between two enormous baboons, strumming
on a banjo as if his very life depended upon
the amount of noise produced.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to say that this was no enjoyment
to him; but it certainly was to the remainder
of the party, and they grinned and chattered their
approbation of the scene, while the one who had
first started the sport stood directly behind the musician,
armed with a long stick.</p>

<p>The unfortunate captive jangled the strings without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
regard to harmony, and fondly fancied that this
was the lowest humiliation he would be forced to
bear. But his genial captors had a different opinion
regarding the matter.</p>

<p>One of the party whom Philip had taught to
climb a pole now seemed to enter into conversation
with Goliah—who shall say that apes cannot talk?—and
a few moments later he and two others left the
apartment.</p>

<p>Philip was playing industriously to save his back
from the shower of blows which descended at the
slightest diminution of noise, when the three animals
returned with a long, stout pole, and the
musician dropped his instrument, literally dazed
with fear and bewilderment, for now he understood
what further sport he would be expected to make
for the entertainment of this long-tailed party.</p>

<p>Was he to be called upon to perform every trick
which had been taught in his emporium of wild animals?
If such should prove to be the case, three
days would hardly suffice in which to display all the
varied accomplishments he had prided himself upon
teaching, and in that time his exertions might prove
fatal.</p>

<p>Cold streams of perspiration ran down his face,
although the ball-room was far from being warm, at
the bare idea of the brutish part he was called upon
to perform.</p>

<p>The pole was there, however, and Goliah’s two
old counselors stood close behind the prisoner,
armed with long, pliant bamboos. Philip understood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
only too well the purpose for which these
whip-like sticks had been brought.</p>

<p>There was no mistaking the gestures with which
they commanded the prisoner to climb the pole, and
from the ingenious way of keeping it upright one
would have fancied they had often performed the
same feat for their own amusement.</p>

<p>Five or six of the smaller apes seated themselves
on the floor, holding the pole at the base. Those
of intermediate height grasped it with their hands a
few inches from the bottom; while the tallest—which
were the baboons and mandrills—threw their
gigantic arms above the others, and planted their
feet as props beyond the lower class.</p>

<p>Goliah advanced toward the captive with an imperious
air as he pointed to the pole and then to the
sticks held by the aged apes. Philip understood
that it would not be wise to hesitate much longer.
In fact he received an immediate and decided incentive
to obey.</p>

<p>Just as he was balancing himself preparatory to
swinging over the living pedestal, one of Goliah’s
advisers struck him two severe blows, which had
the desired effect.</p>

<p>Enraged, but yet fully realizing the danger of
allowing his anger to display itself, he leaped forward
and commenced climbing.</p>

<p>Although he may have been a thoroughly good
teacher, it was not possible for him to practice gracefully
that which he taught; and despite his most
frantic efforts to ascend beyond reach of the bamboo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
poles which the old apes kept constantly in motion,
he could not succeed in climbing more than a few
feet above the heads of those who held the pole.
He would clamber up five or six inches, only to slip
back the same distance, or further, and all the while
the lower portion of his body was a fair target for
his tormentors.</p>

<p>He now deeply regretted ever having attempted
to train a monkey to climb a pole, and still more
bitter were his regrets that he had used for this purpose
a stout whip with which to belabor his pupils
exactly as they were now belaboring him.</p>

<p>The sport of dancing was entirely forgotten in
this new amusement, and each member of the party
seemed to think it the height of pleasure to aid
Goliah’s counselors in their efforts to make matters
lively for the animal-trainer.</p>

<p>He climbed and slipped back, raising himself as
the blows grew more furious, and then, despite all
efforts, fell on the heads of those who were holding
the instrument of torture. His trousers and coat
were torn almost to tatters, and his skin scratched
and bleeding. He was literally in rags before a
quarter of an hour had elapsed, and so thoroughly
exhausted as to be on the point of rebelling, regardless
of the severe punishment which would inevitably
follow, when a lucky accident put an end to
this form of misery.</p>

<p>Under the incentive of blows more severe than
the preceding ones, he leaped upward and at the
same time sideways, grasping the pole higher than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
before. By this means his weight was thrown at an
angle, and the timber gave way in the middle.</p>

<p>The most comical antics of a clown in a circus
would not have called forth such applause as that
which greeted Philip when he fell bruised and
bleeding upon the floor, while the entire company,
even those who were clad in the greatest profusion
of fineries, had a jolly game of leap-frog over his
prostrate body.</p>

<p>For a moment he fancied this signal failure would
cause his tormentors to relinquish the one-sided
sport; but he forgot that among the animals sold to
Captain Seaworth was his most accomplished pupil,
who was now burning with a desire to do his share
toward training the teacher.</p>

<p>Philip had remained as he fell, with his face
buried in his arms to shield it from blows, when a
vicious switch across the back caused him to look up.</p>

<p>He saw before him his talented pupil, for whom
he had received an extra price because of the proficiency
gained, comically scratching his thigh, capering
in the air, thrusting his tongue out in a mocking
fashion, and then whirling about on his head with
both feet spread apart like a bent fork. In fact
this extremely lively animal was repeating all the
grimaces and contortions which had been instilled
into his memory with so many blows of the whip.</p>

<p>This part of the monkey’s performance was evidently
for the benefit of the spectators as well as
Philip. He continued it several moments, and then,
bowing as he had been taught to do when receiving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
applause, stood still, making the most imperative
gestures to the prostrate youth.</p>

<p>Philip had climbed the pole because of the blows
he had received, and also because such a feat was,
to a certain degree, within his power; but to stand on
his head and whirl around like a live teetotum was
impossible. He covered his face with his arms and
remained motionless.</p>

<p>This immobility did not continue but a few
seconds, for a hoarse scream from Goliah caused
half a dozen of the apes to beat his body as if it
had been a drum, until, knowing he would be
pounded to a jelly should he continue to disobey, he
arose to his feet like one who had already tasted the
horrors of the whipping-post.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>




<h2 id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII.<br />
<span class="smaller">FROM THE FRYING-PAN TO THE FIRE.</span></h2>

<p>Never before did an unwilling performer have
such an attentive and at the same time odd-looking
audience. Under other circumstances Philip
would have been convulsed with laughter at the
scene presented in this drawing-room; but just now
it was anything rather than comical, and sorrow instead
of mirth was imprinted upon his face. He,
the redoubtable trainer of animals, was about to attempt
a handspring for a party of apes, baboons,
mandrills and monkeys!</p>

<p>Hardly knowing how to begin, he stood for a moment
hesitating; but the same means which had
been employed to assist him in climbing the pole
was brought into requisition, until his limbs and
back felt as if they had been treated to a bath of
fire.</p>

<p>Then the talented monkey turned one more somersault
in front of Philip and stood in an expectant
attitude. There was no question but that he intended
the performance should be repeated, and the
unfortunate youth did his best to obey. He turned
a somersault, and at the same time twisted his spinal
column until there was every reason to believe it
was dislocated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>Then the instructor stood on his head, and Philip
was obliged to attempt the same maneuver, but
only to fail utterly. As a reward for his awkwardness
the bamboo sticks once more descended in a
shower.</p>

<p>To relate all the misery and sorrows of the hour
which followed would be to tell one long tale of
woe. Suffice it to say that as far as possible the
animal-trainer copied the movements of the demon-like
monkey in front of him. He jumped through
hoops, blew kisses to the audience, went around hat
in hand begging for money, and realized, as never
before, how much labor his pupils had been forced
to perform.</p>

<p>As he had shown anger when they failed, and
treated them with liberal doses of the whip, so did
they give the same token of displeasure because of
his awkward movements.</p>

<p>This painful and humiliating performance might
have continued until it became literally an impossibility
for Philip to raise either a hand or foot, had
it not been for an unexplained diversion.</p>

<p>He was thoroughly exhausted. It seemed that
not even once more could he go through the semblance
of repeating his instructor’s example, and he
believed that the time had come when his career on
this earth would be ended forever, under the castigation
of the apes. At this supreme moment a sudden
uproar in the adjoining apartment caused the
spectators in this new school of ground and lofty
tumbling to rush helter-skelter from the place of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
amusement, and to his most intense relief the unhappy
captive was left alone.</p>

<p>Bruised, bleeding and exhausted as he was, nothing
save the knowledge of his imminent peril could have
induced him to so much as raise a hand. Now,
however, it was absolutely necessary, in order to
save his life, that he leave the village, and, limping
painfully, he made his way through the window to
the street.</p>

<p>In which direction the grotto lay he had no idea,
because of the bewilderment that had come upon
him during the past hour, and it was only possible
to rush blindly forward into the jungle, taking no
heed of his steps save that each one carried him further
away from the scene of his humiliation and
punishment.</p>

<p>Stumbling, falling, rising only to fall again, he
pushed on amid the tangled foliage, nerved to almost
superhuman exertions by the knowledge of what his
fate might be in case an escape was not effected.</p>

<p>In this manner, hardly knowing whether he continued
in a straight course or moved in a circle, he
managed to press forward until the underbrush became
more sparse, and hope again sprung up in his
heart. He supposed he had arrived at the banana
grove, where it was possible to procure food, and
from whence he would have but little difficulty in
finding the grotto.</p>

<p>But for the fact that the events and ill-treatment
of the evening had dazed him, he would have exercised
more care while traveling over an unknown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
country. As it was, however, he walked blindly on,
until he found himself sinking amid the slime and
water of a jungle marsh.</p>

<p>That which he had mistaken for the banana plantation
was one of those open morasses so frequent
in this portion of the globe; and as the cold water
flowed around his aching body he realized the danger
in which he had thus incautiously placed himself.</p>

<p>In attempting to raise his feet and scramble back
to more solid earth he sunk the deeper, and then
reason gave way to fear.</p>

<p>He knew that any effort on his part would make
the situation more dangerous; but this was forgotten
in the frenzy which came upon him.</p>

<p>At the first plunge the water had only been
within a few inches of his knees; in five minutes it
was at his waist, his lower limbs being so imprisoned
that any further movement of his feet was impossible.</p>

<p>Now came a new cause for alarm. He had felt
himself growing weak for several moments, but believing
the faintness was caused by exertions made
during his rapid flight he paid no attention to the
fact until, when held prisoner by the mud, he discovered
that his hands, face and neck were covered
with what at first glance appeared to be small caterpillars,
dark brown in color and striped with vivid
yellow.</p>

<p>Under the most favorable circumstances they
were disgusting-looking creatures; but now, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
by reason of his dangerous position every disagreeable
object was magnified, they seemed positively
repulsive. He attempted to brush away three or
four which had fastened on the back of his hand,
and to his mingled surprise and horror they clung
the tighter.</p>

<p>Taking hold of one with his thumb and finger he
was forced to use no slight amount of strength in
removing it, and then a cry of terror burst from his
lips as he discovered that the repulsive thing was
sucking his blood.</p>

<p>He was covered with forest-leeches, which had attached
themselves to him during his flight through
the woods, and his sudden and excessive weakness
arose from the enormous quantities of life-blood
which they had drained from his veins. For the instant
his dangerous predicament was forgotten in
this new cause for alarm, and during five minutes he
paid but little attention to the fact that he was
sinking deeper and deeper into the mire while pulling
the tiny vampires from his flesh.</p>

<p>Once these pests were removed, however, all the
horrors of his situation came upon him with redoubled
force.</p>

<p>He was alone in a swamp, which continued to engulf
him despite all efforts, and it seemed certain
that life, so painful but a short time previous, was
about to be extinguished.</p>

<p>However much one may wish for the approach of
death, he instinctively struggles against it when the
summons comes. So it was with Philip. An hour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
ago suffocation in the marsh would have seemed
preferable to the dangers by which he was surrounded;
and yet, when the supreme moment was
so near at hand, the desire for life became strong
once more.</p>

<p>Any efforts of his were useless, and to summon
aid would be to call around him the enemies from
whom he had been endeavoring to escape; but now
that it was a question of life or death, he did not
hesitate.</p>

<p>Again and again he cried for help, knowing that
if his words were not understood, those who had
probably been sent in search of him would be attracted
to the spot by his voice. The exertion necessary
to make this appeal caused him to sink deeper
and deeper in the treacherous mud, but he continued
to shout until the rustling of foliage warned him
that help, even though attended by danger, was at
hand.</p>

<p>He expected to see the grinning face of Goliah
or some of his adherents, and even these would
have been welcome; but to his inexpressible delight
it was the faithful chimpanzee who had responded
to his cry for help.</p>

<p>Alice recognized his danger at once, and wasted
no time in investigations. With one paw clutching
the trunk of a tree, which grew on solid ground,
she extended the other to him, and he grasped it
with the same desperate energy that a drowning
man does the plank pushed out to save him from
death.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>His own strength would have been insufficient to
release him from the predicament, for the mire had a
hold stronger than human hands; but his rescuer
was powerful of limb, and, as he clutched her wrist
with both hands, she drew him safely to the shore.</p>

<p>It was several moments before he was able to make
any movement toward leaving the place, and during
all this while Alice intimated, by the expression
of her face as well as by her gestures of anxiety,
that he should follow her.</p>

<p>When he had partially recovered from the exhaustion
superinduced by his flight and subsequent
struggles, Philip motioned for the chimpanzee to
proceed, and at a rapid pace she led him through
the jungle in, as he thought, the direction of the
grotto.</p>

<p>Only once during this fatiguing journey did the
animal halt, and then it was before a bubbling
spring which, singularly enough in a land of luxuriant
vegetation, stood in a space of at least a hundred
square yards whereon not so much as a blade
of grass was growing.</p>

<p>To find on this island such an arid spot caused
Philip surprise, even though he was so distressed
both in body and mind; but he was not in a condition
to search for the cause, and would have passed
by without halting, motioning to Alice that he was
not thirsty, if she by her gestures had not insisted
on his taking note of the water.</p>

<p>Thinking the best way to satisfy her would be to
raise a few drops to his lips, he dipped his hand in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
the spring. Instead of feeling the grateful contact
of cool liquid upon his flesh, it seemed as if he had
touched diluted lye. It was slightly warm, not of
a very pleasant odor, and as he attempted to rub the
moisture from his fingers a lather like that made by
soap was produced.</p>

<p>For an instant he was at a loss to understand the
meaning of this apparent phenomenon, and then came
the thought that he had heard his friend, Captain
Seaworth, speak of these soap-springs to be found
in the Malay Archipelago. It was a discovery which
he welcomed quite as gladly as though it had been
pure water and he half-famished with thirst.</p>

<p>Hastily throwing off his clothes he plunged to the
neck in the soapy liquid, and never before was a
bath more refreshing to a weary mortal.</p>

<p>Lathering his flesh again and again, he washed
away all traces of his plunge in the swamp, and
after rubbing himself thoroughly, felt that delicious
sense of cleanliness which is so refreshing. The
only difficulty was to rid himself of the soapy substance,
for however often he might plunge beneath
the surface the foam would appear every time he
passed his hand over his flesh, and it was only when
in a partial state of dryness that he put on his
clothes once more, making gestures to the chimpanzee
that he was ready to continue the journey.</p>

<p>Although monkeys are not supposed to wash
themselves, it was quite evident she knew the
properties of this water—perhaps from seeing some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
of the colonists use it—and Philip could not fail to
wonder at the intelligence she displayed.</p>

<p>After half an hour’s rapid traveling the astonishment
of the fugitive can be imagined when, instead
of arriving at the grotto, he found himself inside the
village.</p>

<p>This was the one spot of all others on the island
which he wished to avoid, and to the utmost of his
ability he represented by gesture that it was in the
highest degree dangerous for him to go near Goliah.</p>

<p>Had Alice been able to speak his language she
could not have replied more expressively. By her
movements he was made to understand that his
former place of hiding was known to the huge
baboon, and that it would be possible to secrete himself
only in the very midst of his enemies.</p>

<p>“What matters it?” he said to himself. “The
chimpanzee can lead me into no greater danger than
that to which I have already been exposed, and I
will follow her as confidently as I would a human
being.”</p>

<p>Then he motioned Alice to proceed, and she led
the way, much to his surprise, directly through the
main street of the settlement, where not a single
ape, monkey or baboon was to be seen.</p>

<p>Probably all had gone in search of him, and,
knowing this, Alice had formed her plans accordingly.
She went directly to the house which he
had just left, and opened the door of the reception-room
where he had experienced so much humiliation
and pain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>Then, as if to say that her continued absence
might excite suspicion, she motioned to the doors
and wooden shutters of the windows as if advising
that they be closed, and left him to his own reflections.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>




<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX.<br />
<span class="smaller">BESIEGED.</span></h2>

<p>The behavior of the chimpanzee, as well as
his own good common sense, which he had had
time to recover since the adventure in the marsh,
told Philip that it would be useless longer to fly
from his enemies. He was in a building constructed
with especial reference to safety from outside foes,
and by barricading himself in the series of rooms
which led from the kitchen to the parlor he might
be able to stand a siege of many days.</p>

<p>It is true he had no reason to expect aid, since it
seemed most likely Captain Seaworth’s party had
been massacred; but yet time to wait for the coming
of human companions was the one thing desired,
and to such end he made every preparation.</p>

<p>On this, as well as on the other side of the building,
each window had heavy wooden shutters which
could be closed from the inside, and the doors were
sufficiently stout to resist any attack which might
be made by the apes. As a matter of course, a
determined body of men with the proper tools could
soon effect an entrance; but it was hardly probable
the animals would be able to break in after the place
was once properly fortified.</p>

<p>Philip understood that there was no time to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
lost, for at any moment Goliah and his forces might
return. Therefore his first act was to shut and
barricade the three doors leading to the veranda.
Then the heavy shutters of the windows were closed
and bolted, half a dozen candles were lighted, and
the fortification was as nearly complete as he could
make it.</p>

<p>He now experienced a sense of security such as
had not visited him since the moment when he was
thrown upon these inhospitable shores. There was
on hand sufficient food to last a long time, and he
felt safe from any immediate danger.</p>

<p>The one thing needful at this moment was slumber,
and with a mind free from apprehensions he
made up such a bed in the dining-room as even a
less weary youth would not have disdained, closing
his eyes in peaceful sleep almost instantly after
lying down.</p>

<p>He awakened in a calmer frame of mind than he
had known since the time when the good bark
Swallow first encountered the gale, and was fully
alive to all the possibilities of his situation. He had
no difficulty in coming to the conclusion that so
long as he was destined to remain on the island he
would be exposed to a vengeance worse than death
at the hands of those whom he had once treated as
articles of merchandise. At present he believed
himself to be perfectly secure; but as a matter of
course, if he should dare to venture forth it would
be to become the object of renewed attacks, which
very likely would end only in his death.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>It was with such thoughts that his mind was occupied
as he took from the kitchen cupboard a fresh
supply of candles to replace those long since consumed,
and then examined his miniature fortress to
see if there was any vulnerable point of attack
which he had overlooked.</p>

<p>There was a second story, and through this it
might be possible the apes could effect an entrance,
therefore he lost no time in examining the upper
portion of his refuge.</p>

<p>The rooms above were of the same size as those
on the ground-floor; but directly over the corner
was a small bell-tower open on all four sides, and
entered by a trap-door. This last was secured by
two iron bolts which shut into mortices in the main
timbers of the building, and, as he believed, were
sufficiently strong to resist any ordinary attack.</p>

<p>It was in this corner apartment over the parlor
that Captain Seaworth had established his private
office, and, strange to say, it had thus far escaped
the observation of the apes. Everything was in the
most complete order. The books, papers and boxes
which filled the shelves on either side were as the
commander of the ill-fated colony had left them.
On the writing-desk lay an unfinished letter to the
stockholders of the corporation, probably abandoned
when the writer was called upon to resist this army
of apes.</p>

<p>It was not necessary for Philip to close the heavy
window-shutters, for they were already bolted, and
in each was a sort of Venetian blind about four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
inches square, which permitted a view of the surrounding
country while the spectator remained hidden.</p>

<p>Before examining further Philip looked from these
loop-holes, and to his dismay saw that he was already
besieged.</p>

<p>At every point of vantage on the outside his enemies
were posted. On the elevations of land in the
immediate vicinity, the branches of the trees, and
even the tops of the surrounding buildings, were
groups of apes, who watched this portion of the
house as if understanding that in it was hidden the
human animal from whom they expected such rare
entertainment or revenge.</p>

<p>There could be no question but that they were on
the <i lang="fr">qui vive</i>, and at the slightest movement of their
captive would begin an attack. It was the silent
siege of an enemy who did not consider it necessary
to conceal himself behind his lines of defense.</p>

<p>Philip viewed the scene much as does a general
when surveying a battle-field. For the apes to
climb up the sides of the house, whereon were no
projecting points, he knew was an impossibility, as
it also was for them to effect an entrance through
the barricaded doors and windows. To reach the
tower from the adjoining buildings would not be
difficult for such agile climbers; but once there their
opportunities for attack would be no better than on
the street below.</p>

<p>That Goliah was preparing for battle seemed
hardly probable, since it is not generally believed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
that animals know anything concerning warfare;
but yet he was certainly bringing up his troops in
the most soldier-like fashion. From the loop-holes
Philip could see company after company marching
to this point or that in regular order; and no less
than twenty of the larger baboons, each wearing a
saber by his side, were making regular rounds of the
clearing, as if inspecting the troops.</p>

<p>To give it more the appearance of a regular siege,
only certain of these long-tailed warriors were on
watch, the others remaining close at hand in readiness
to open the battle at the first warning cry.
These idle ones were amusing themselves in a variety
of ways. Some were wrestling, others playing
leap-frog, and not a few apparently interested in
story-telling—at least so it seemed to Philip in this
latter case, for parties of from fifteen to twenty
were gathered around some venerable monkey who
appeared to be talking very earnestly.</p>

<p>Now and then Goliah would harangue the troops
in the same manner as he had addressed those composing
the court-martial, and that he was making
direct reference to the house and its occupant could
be told from the fact that he frequently pointed to
those on guard as well as to the building, finally going
through a series of threatening gestures, as if
explaining what he proposed to do when the time
for action should come.</p>

<p>But for Philip’s knowledge of how nearly apes
can copy the movements of men he would have
laughed at the baboons’ antics; but yet he could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
bring himself to believe his fortifications were in
danger of being carried, or that the enemy would
make any real assault.</p>

<p>It seemed only reasonable to suppose the brutes
would not continue very long a siege which he could
well sustain, according to the contents of his larder,
for many weeks; therefore, being tranquil in mind,
he could afford to examine leisurely his place of
refuge.</p>

<p>A search resulted in his finding quite as much
food for the mind as for the body, which was a
great boon, considering the length of time he might
be confined in this limited space. The apartment
directly over the kitchen had been fitted up as a
library and lounging-room, probably for the benefit
of Captain Seaworth’s officers, and here was a collection
of books of travel.</p>

<p>In such an out-of-the-way corner of the world
these silent companions would be of the utmost
value even in the case of those who enjoyed freedom
of action, but to Philip in his present condition they
were rare treasures.</p>

<p>His investigations in this quarter were ended for
the time being, and descending to the kitchen, he
made such a breakfast of canned provisions as was
in the highest degree satisfactory, washing it down
with moderate draughts of light wine. Then he betook
himself once more to Captain Seaworth’s private
office in the hope of finding something which
would give him a clew to the reasons why the island
had thus been left to Goliah and his followers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>A single written line indicating a combined attack
of the apes would explain why a large body
of men had been overcome by the animals; yet,
armed as the colonists undoubtedly were, able to
shelter themselves behind the walls of the buildings,
it did not seem as if any number of the monkey-tribe
could vanquish such a force as he knew had
made their headquarters on this island.</p>

<p>Yet it appeared as if such must have been the
case, and Philip searched among the papers in the
hope of solving the riddle.</p>

<p>There were statements of moneys paid to the
laborers, a detailed account of the erection of all
the buildings, together with mention of the time
occupied in unloading the vessel, dates as to when
the crops had been planted, memoranda to show
what portion of the jungle was intended should be
cleared, and in fact all the minutiæ of the business
connected with establishing the colony, but no
word relative to such enemies as Philip had encountered.</p>

<p>Not until he was about to abandon the search did
he find that for which he sought. A large book
lying carelessly at one side of the room had hitherto
escaped his observation because it seemed to be of
little importance, and he opened it without any idea
that it might be the document for which he had
been hunting so eagerly.</p>

<p>The first page was sufficient to arrest his attention,
for on it was written, in bold letters, and in round,
clear characters:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Log of the ship Reynard, and Journal of my stay at
Luzon.</i></p>

<p>Here was what Philip had been most anxious to
find, and without thought of the grinning faces
which were keeping close watch over the building
he seated himself in an arm-chair, believing the
mystery was about to be solved.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>




<h2 id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX.<br />
<span class="smaller">CAPTAIN SEAWORTH’S JOURNAL.</span></h2>

<p>The dry details of the log-book did not interest
Philip save as they showed him that the
Reynard arrived at the island after a reasonably
prosperous voyage, with the colonists and crew in
the best of health.</p>

<p>He read of the exploration of the island, where
mention was made of the extinct volcano which he
had already seen, and learned that the village was
on the southernmost of the Toukang-Basi group.</p>

<p>Then, in rapid succession, he noted the author’s
remarks relative to certain portions of the land
which it was proposed to cultivate, ran his eye carelessly
over the meteorological observations, and
passed quickly on to those pages where mention was
made of the settlement, referring to which Captain
Sea worth wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The portable houses prove to be a most admirable
invention. In fifteen days we have unloaded and
set up every building, and not one joist has been
wrongly measured or marked. In that short space
of time we built an entire village resembling those
to be found in Sumatra, and are as comfortably
situated as the most captious colonist could desire.</p>

<p>The Reynard has been brought around to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
eastern shore, where we have found a small bay with
water enough to float a line-of-battle ship, and the
banks of which are so densely wooded that it is impossible
to see a hundred yards in either direction.
But for the fact that we are in the very center of a
nest of Malay pirates, I should have no hesitation
whatever about leaving her at moorings in charge of
the boatswain. As it is, however, I am obliged to
keep half the crew quartered on board, which reduces
my working force very materially.</p>

<p>If this colony does not succeed it will unquestionably
be because of the ever-increasing audacity of
the pirates who infest the seas in this part of the
world. Their power increases year by year, and
their flotillas have become fleets. The proas and
junks are armed like frigates, and as sailors and
fighting-men their crews are the most energetic of
any nation; therefore it is that to guard against
these marauders is the most important of all our
duties, and better the work of planting should progress
slowly than that we run the risk of having the
fruits of our labor destroyed through neglect of precaution.</p>

<p>The soil of the island is evidently very fertile.
Flowers and fruits are abundant, and the thickest
positively swarm with game. Save for the apes,
which are as thick here as grasshoppers in a country
field, this would be a garden spot indeed. But the
apes destroy the charm of the place, since one must
be constantly on watch against them, and they increase
like flies. Unless some means can be devised
to exterminate them we shall be forced to guard our
plantations by night as well as by day, and therefore
I have many serious misgivings as to whether the
venture which has been so admirably planned will
prove successful. To defend ourselves against the
pirates from the ocean, and to save our crops from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
apes, we need at least two hundred more men; and
whether I shall be justified in making the additional
outlay, after it was decided that there were to be no
further expenditures, is the question which disturbs
me greatly.</p>

<p>To guard against these monkey-robbers, who pull
up our plants from sheer love of mischief, a high,
barbed-wire fence would answer every purpose; but,
unfortunately, it would cost more for such material
than the additional force required, because it must
be sent out in a ship from New York. My first
officer counsels that we visit Lombok, Batavia, or
Samarang, for the purpose of procuring natives, and
his opinion I should incline to were it not for the
fact that I am afraid to withdraw the entire ship’s
crew from the island lest the colonists be overcome
either by pirates or apes, the latter being quite as
formidable as the former.</p></div>

<p>Here followed many notes regarding the labor already
performed or projected; and continuing after
the banana plantation had been started, Captain Seaworth
wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Our house life is charming. The colonists are enjoying
the best of health, in houses surrounded with
palm-trees; and as for our own quarters, I never had
anything to compare with these, not even in Madras,
in point of comfort and elegance. We want for
nothing, and our amusements are numerous. Once
each week we give a ball in the drawing-room of the
main building, and on Saturday mornings we hold
an informal court on the open lawn to decide as
to the business and government of our charming
island.</p>

<p>Again I am constrained to speak of our pests,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
the apes. So numerous are they, in fact, that one
is almost certain, in discharging a gun at hazard, to
bring down an animal; and their ferocity exceeds
anything of which I have ever read. Those we
brought from the establishment of Garland &amp; Co.
are civilized beings compared with the tribe we find
here. It is a source of many jokes that we should
have taken the trouble to bring so far pets which
could be captured in such numbers. Instead of buying
apes, we could ship a full cargo and never know
they had left the island.</p></div>

<p>Again, the journal was continued with notes which
would interest the stockholders of the enterprise
more than they did Philip, and he passed hastily
over them until he found the following:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>I have been trying to teach the gigantic baboon,
Goliah, to follow me in the semi-weekly hunts we
make for apes. Although hundreds are killed on
each occasion the numbers do not seem to diminish,
and we have decided to make hunters, if possible, of
the apes we brought with us. Goliah, especially,
would be invaluable could he be trained to prey
upon those of his kind who so disturb us. Thus far,
however, we have met with only partial success.</p>

<p>During our excursion yesterday, while in the
center of a large wood of mimosas, where I had
wandered with the baboon, I suddenly saw advancing
toward me with a club, which he carried like a
drum-major’s cane, a gigantic mandrill, black as a
negro, and followed by a regiment of apes.</p>

<p>Goliah, generally so fierce and courageous,
trembled with terror as he beheld this enormous
animal. He recognized in him a conqueror, and
consequently one to be feared. For the first time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
since owning him he crouched by my side like a
frightened dog imploring protection, at the same
time gnashing his teeth and beating his breast as he
glanced furtively toward the gigantic beast who confronted
him. This was the opportunity for which I
had sought. If my baboon would fight the mandrill
and come off victorious it might be possible the
lesson had been learned, and I raised my rifle with
the intention of wounding the brute, in order to
make it more certain Goliah would vanquish him.</p>

<p>Before I could discharge the weapon, however,
the gigantic stranger leaped upon Goliah regardless
of my presence, and the struggle between the two
animals was terrific. Unquestionably my baboon
would speedily have been killed, for in a few
seconds he received most terrible punishment, and I
was forced to fire at the risk of hitting the wrong
one. Fortunately my aim was perfect, and the
colossal mandrill fell dead.</p>

<p>Never have I seen any animal display so much
joy as did Goliah when his enemy expired. He
would first shower blows upon the body, and then
fawn on me with the most extravagant demonstrations
of pleasure and thankfulness. With each
buffet of the carcass his courage seemed to return,
and I flatter myself that after a few more lessons
he will understand his mission is the slaughter of
these long-tailed pests.</p>

<p>The apes who accompanied the mandrill dispersed
immediately after his fall without offering
any violence, but from the threatening demonstrations
made to Goliah it seemed as if they were vowing
vengeance; and he must have understood something
of the kind, for despite his returning courage
he hugged closer to my side, trembling violently all
the while. Could they have gotten hold of him at
that moment, the largest baboon ever owned by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
Garland &amp; Co. would soon have been food for the
ants.</p>

<p>I shall have this enormous mandrill skinned, and
dry his hide and bones, in order to present them to
the Museum at Central Park on my return home.</p></div>

<p>“Then this is the story of the skeleton I found
hanging on the mimosas when I was first cast ashore
here,” Philip said to himself. “He must have hung
it there that the ants might devour the flesh. But
how much different would have been my position
had the captain or the mandrill killed Goliah! I
think I should most heartily enjoy seeing the bones
of that vicious baboon hanging side by side with
those among the mimosas.”</p>

<p>This portion of the journal was concluded with
two paragraphs, both of which were particularly interesting
to Philip, and he read as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>From what I have heard of the habits of these
peculiar animals, coupled with my own observations,
I am of the opinion that the mandrill which I killed
was the chief or leader of all the apes on the island,
and am greatly in hopes the death of this beast may
prevent many of their predatory excursions.</p>

<p>On returning from this hunt I placed my rifle in
the concealed armory, because I do not wish the baboons
to get the idea that I use anything but the
weapons provided by nature, for it might make them
timid in the hunt which I am determined they shall
indulge in before many weeks more.</p></div>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>




<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI.<br />
<span class="smaller">A HAPPY DISCOVERY.</span></h2>

<p>The last paragraph which Philip read caused
him to leap from his chair in very excess of
joy, since through it he learned that concealed somewhere
in the building—probably very near where he
sat—was a collection of weapons. If only so much
as one rifle could be found, he would be reasonably
certain of holding his besiegers at bay, at least until
the provisions were exhausted.</p>

<p>Heeding not the volume, which had fallen to the
floor, he made a hasty circuit of the room, opening
closet after closet until all but one had been examined,
and in this last he found that for which he
sought. Captain Seaworth had referred to it as
“the armory,” but it must have been his own private
sporting weapons, for there were three fine
fowling-pieces, two rifles, and a large quantity of
cartridges made up for every kind of game.</p>

<p>To buckle on one of the ammunition-belts, fill it
with ball-cartridges and seize a rifle from the hooks
was but the work of a moment, after which Philip
felt that at last he was in a condition to cope with a
hundred such as Goliah.</p>

<p>It was hardly possible to exterminate all the apes
on the island from the windows of the building, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
he could certainly slay the most vicious, and having
done so, would in a certain measure be free to move
around.</p>

<p>Philip now understood that Goliah had taken the
place of the mandrill whom Captain Seaworth
killed, and was exercising the rights of leader over
them—an office which they probably respected because
he approached so nearly in size to their late
chief. With Goliah and his counselors dead, however,
Philip’s position would be far more safe, if not
comfortable, and using the two chimpanzees as
guard, it might be possible to roam about the island
at will. Then he could gather yet more gold from
the subterranean stream, and stow it away preparatory
to removal as soon as any vessel might visit
that shore, unless, indeed, the pirates spoken of in
the journal should first make their appearance.</p>

<p>Now that he felt reasonably secure from the apes
he began to fear those marauders of the sea about
whom he had read, and he could readily fancy that
to them was due the absence of the colonists. The
pirates had most likely made a raid upon the island,
and killed or carried off as prisoners those who were
trying to establish the plantation.</p>

<p>Although this seemed the true and only reasonable
explanation as to why Captain Seaworth and
his party had disappeared, it was certainly strange
and beyond Philip’s power to imagine why a more
thorough sack of the buildings had not taken place.
That the pirates should leave all this property—for
so far as he had seen the houses were filled with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
plentiful supply of movable goods—seemed incomprehensible;
but he was not disposed to waste
much time in these useless speculations. It was as
if he wished to enjoy the sense of security given by
the weapons, and advancing to the window he
gazed through the loop-holes into the street.</p>

<p>The besiegers were still in the same places and
the same attitudes of hostility, but they had increased
in numbers. From this point of vantage he
counted among the foliage and crouching behind the
trunks of the trees more than a hundred animals,
all watching the closed windows with the greatest
intentness, and evidently waiting for an opportunity
to begin the attack.</p>

<p>Philip laughed to himself as he saw the vindictive
faces of the apes, and thought what a surprise he
had in store for them, or how useless would be their
attempts to drive him out. But he failed to realize
what they could do in case of an attack, or how
fierce might be the battle. The knowledge that he
had plenty of ammunition caused him to look upon
these brute enemies with a certain disdain which
was destined to be changed to one of fear before
many days passed.</p>

<p>Leaving his position at the window he took the
journal from the floor and laid it on the table, but
without any intention of reading it. He would
have plenty of time in which to pursue the investigation,
and was resolved now to enjoy himself after
his own fashion. Besides, he was weary with
sitting still so long, and hungry. A further perusal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
of the document which might reveal to him the
cause of the colonists’ absence could be had at any
time, and there would undoubtedly be many dull
hours to while away; consequently he was in no
haste to finish the captain’s story.</p>

<p>A spiral staircase from the library led to the
rooms below, and he went into the kitchen intending
there to have a hearty meal, for it would be
foolish not to enjoy that with which he was so
generously provided.</p>

<p>There was an ample store of candles, and he
lighted half a dozen in order to give the semblance
of a feast to his lonely repast.</p>

<p>Since his stay was indefinite and might be prolonged
even into months, he resolved to be methodical
in his manner of living. Therefore, as the first
step in this direction, he set about arranging the
table with as much care as if he was to entertain a
party of epicures.</p>

<p>Even at this moment, when he fancied his wants
were so generously provided for, came the knowledge
that he would be denied water. During his
previous repast he congratulated himself that there
was plenty of wine, and thought this the most pleasant
method of assuaging thirst; but now he was of
a different opinion. Although having been deprived
of nature’s beverage so short a time, he would have
bartered a case of the finest champagne in Captain
Seaworth’s collection for a single pint of such water
as he had found in the grotto. But this it was impossible
to obtain, and during the elaborate meal he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
fancied how refreshing would be coffee or tea rather
than the rare vintages with which he was plentifully
supplied.</p>

<p>In the preparation of this meal he had an opportunity
of taking account of the stores on hand, and,
as nearly as could be judged, there was sufficient to
last him at least three months; therefore fear of
starvation was not among his troubles.</p>

<p>A hearty meal was conducive to sleep, and being
thoroughly the master of his own time, Philip
ascended the narrow staircase to the captain’s bed-chamber,
where, for the first time since the gale
which wrecked the Swallow sprung up, he was able
to undress and retire in a Christian-like fashion.</p>

<p>The unwonted luxury of a soft bed, clean sheets
and pillows, were well calculated to keep him within
the borders of dreamland many hours, and when he
awakened the morning sun was just peeping in
through the crevices of the blind in the shutter.</p>

<p>With the awakening came the further and perhaps
even greater desire for water. He was denied
even the pleasure of washing his face unless with
wine, and contented himself as best he could by
using a dry towel, after which he descended once
more to the kitchen, where he made anything rather
than a hearty meal of canned dainties. He was beginning
to tire of delicacies, and remembered with
regret the coarse food from which he had turned
with disgust while on board the Swallow.</p>

<p>It is strange in what a channel one’s fancies sometimes
run. Here was Philip, virtually a prisoner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
on an island inhabited by apes who would rend him
limb from limb should he venture out of doors, and
yet he was longing ardently for a commonplace
plate of hash, and a cup of the weakest coffee that
was ever set before the patrons of a cheap boarding-house
would have tasted at that moment like nectar.
However, neither the hash nor the coffee was to be
had for the wishing, and he ascended once more to
the library.</p>

<p>Another view of the surroundings was anything
rather than reassuring. The apes were there, with
numbers still further increased, occupying the same
points of vantage as when he had seen them the
day previous, and now each had in front of him, or
in a crotch of a tree where he was located, a little
pile of heavy stones stacked up with as much care
as if they had been cartridges, and Philip was soon
to learn that they would be almost as effective as
the heaviest charged shell in his collection.</p>

<p>His first thought on noting these missiles was that
they were intended for him as soon as he made his
appearance out of doors. He failed to comprehend
how the apes might use them; but all too soon did
he understand.</p>

<p>For a moment he stood undetermined whether to
give his assailants a taste of powder and ball at
once, believing a lesson might be beneficial; but the
thought of the unfinished journal restrained him.</p>

<p>“I have plenty of time in which to show what
can be done with fire-arms,” he said to himself, “and
it won’t interfere with the effectiveness of the dose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
if I wait until the hours begin to drag. Beside, it
is to Goliah that the first instruction must be given,
and then that little ape who made me stand on my
head shall be the next to receive one of the captain’s
bullets.”</p>

<p>Thus it was that a desire for revenge had come
into Philip’s mind with the first assurance of his
own safety, as it often comes to the minds of others.
We arrogate to ourselves the right to teach, and
cloak under it a vengeance oftentimes as childish as
the besieged animal-trainer’s may seem.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII.<br />
<span class="smaller">SOLVING THE MYSTERY.</span></h2>

<p>With the happy belief in his mind that he
could punish and drive away his assailants
whenever he should feel so disposed, Philip seated
himself once more in the captain’s arm-chair and
opened the journal at the page whereon he had
found the welcome information concerning the
weapons.</p>

<p>It was no longer like a person who believes himself
in danger that Philip continued the story. The
fire-arms and stock of ammunition had given him a
sense of almost perfect security, and to have seen
him as he took up the book one would have supposed
him to be some prosperous planter’s son
rather than a shipwrecked youth surrounded on all
sides by brute enemies.</p>

<p>Philip had ceased reading at the point where the
mystery attending the disappearance of the colonists
was apparently solved, and now the lines which followed
caused him to be oblivious of everything
around. The additional information was couched in
the following words:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>We have this morning discovered that which gives
my officers and myself the greatest uneasiness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
There can no longer be any question but that the
pirates have learned of our whereabouts, and are already
meditating an attack, in which case we shall
be almost entirely at their mercy, for the ship is not
armed sufficiently heavy to resist such an onslaught
as may be expected.</p>

<p>It has been the subject of consultation during the
forenoon, and opinion seems to be equally divided as
to whether we ought to abandon the plantation, or
destroy the ship and hold out as long as possible in
such frail refuge as the buildings of the village will
afford. In the event of our deciding upon this last
plan, it is an open question with me whether we
will not be sacrificing more than if we left the
island until a sufficient force of natives can be procured
from one of the Dutch settlements to augment
our army until we are able to cope with these
scourges of the seas.</p>

<p>The cause of our uneasiness may seem a trifling
one to the uninitiated, but those who are at all familiar
with the customs of the Malays can readily
understand how imminent is the danger which
threatens.</p>

<p>Last evening Mr. Clark, who is in command of
the ship while she lays at anchorage, believed he
saw the reflection of a light from the southernmost
point of the island, but owing to the lateness of the
hour he did not report such fact to me. This morning
at daybreak he, with half a dozen of the crew,
proceeded to that portion of the beach where the
fire was supposed to have been built, and the absence
of any embers in the vicinity convinced him
that he had been mistaken or else a vessel was
burned many miles off the coast. On returning to
the Reynard, however, he found sufficient proof
that the pirates had been on shore within the past
twenty-four hours, for sticking in the sand directly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
opposite the ship was a Malay creese. It is such a
menace as cannot be misunderstood. Before making
an attack the pirates, in case members of their
own tribe are at a station to be destroyed, leave
such a weapon near by as token that they must be
ready to use their own creeses when the battle begins.
We have among the colonists four Malays,
whom we took from Batavia as interpreters in the
event of our finding any natives on this island.</p>

<p>I am positive these four did not see the sinister
message, otherwise the knife would have been removed;
and I have just given Mr. Clark orders to
forbid the sailors to leave the ship lest the fact
should become known to those who may have joined
us simply for the purpose of aiding in the massacre
which would probably take place if the pirates
landed. Judging from what I have read and heard,
it is not likely we shall be molested for several days;
therefore sufficient time yet remains in which to decide
upon our course of action.</p>

<p>At this moment the arrival of a ship would be
most opportune. I am positive any captain could
be persuaded or hired to remain at anchor here
three or four weeks, while a portion of our company
sailed in search of natives. In any event, word
could be sent to Batavia; therefore, in the hope of
signaling a vessel that shall lend such assistance, I
have had a fire built in the crater of the old volcano,
which is the highest point of land, and detailed a
force of men to feed it night and day. Should any
European craft pass within sight, her commander
would unquestionably endeavor to learn the reason
for the beacon, and thus my object may be attained.</p></div>

<p>“I am gradually learning the cause of the apes’
movements,” Philip said to himself, as he looked up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
from the book thoughtfully. “Goliah’s force probably
enjoyed the glare of the flames, and since then,
when having nothing better to occupy their attention,
have kept the fire alive as I saw it on the
night they captured me. If I ever succeed in reaching
home again I shall have a true story to tell
which will seem in the highest degree improbable.”</p>

<p>Then he turned his attention to the journal once
more, and read the following:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>During the past week the officers have been making
ready for a ball to be held in this building, and
I do not consider it necessary to put an end to the
festivities. This merry-making will serve to allay
any suspicions regarding our safety which may have
sprung up among the colonists, owing to our protracted
consultation of the morning, and it is in the
highest degree essential that no panic shall ensue,
whatever plan we may decide upon. The officers
are warned to keep our deliberations a secret, and
the people will dance and sing as if we were in perfect
security, instead of living, as is really the case,
on the crater of a sleeping volcano, which has already
begun to seethe and boil preparatory to an
eruption.</p></div>

<p>This last paragraph completed the page, and Philip
eagerly turned to the next leaf, but it was blank.
The journal, which he had believed would extend
very much further, was suddenly ended. Not a
word respecting the ball, nor any mention of the
weapon left in the sand!</p>

<p>A sinister blank followed the last line penned by
the captain. What had happened to the colony and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
to the writer himself since this final entry? No one
was present to answer these questions; but an ominous
reply was written everywhere around in the
silence and desolation; the houses partially destroyed
and their contents pillaged; savage and vindictive
animals wearing, as if in raillery, the habiliments
of gallant officers.</p>

<p>During the remainder of that day Philip sat in
the library studying over what was apparently a
solution of the mystery, but arriving at no satisfactory
conclusion. It seemed almost certain the
pirates had interrupted the merry-making, and that
the captain was massacred before the dawning of
another morning, otherwise he would have written
more, for the journal bore evidence of an entry,
however slight or insignificant, each day.</p>

<p>“But,” Philip asked himself, “if the Malays did
make the descent, why was not the village destroyed,
and why were the valuable contents of the
houses left behind? If the pirates overcame the
colonists they would have had plenty of opportunity
to sack and pillage, for there was no possibility of
an interruption, since they were masters of the surrounding
sea.”</p>

<p>One other supposition flashed across Philips mind,
although it seemed too absurd to be seriously entertained,
and this was that the apes had forestalled
the murderous intentions of the pirates. Despite
the apparent foolishness of such a conjecture Philip
could not banish the idea, even though he said many
times that if all belonging to the colony had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
assassinated in some mysterious way, he would certainly
have found their remains during his travels
since the shipwreck.</p>

<p>Night came and he was still seated in the library
sad and disheartened. During the hours of darkness
he alternately slumbered and speculated upon
the tragedy which must have taken place. Before
morning he solved the mystery or believed he did;
and, terrible as was his theory, it had strangely ’
enough the effect of calming him to a wonderful degree.</p>

<p>“It can only be accounted for by the fact that
the creese had been left on the shore earlier than
the officer of the ship believed,” he said aloud, as if
addressing a companion. “The light which Mr.
Clark thinks he fancied must have been a reality—a
signal to other vessels in the vicinity. While the
ball was at its height the pirates landed, so completely
surprising the merry-makers that resistance
was more than useless; therefore no blood was
shed, but every member of the party was made
prisoner. At that moment, according to my belief,
a body of apes appeared, and the pirates, in the
darkness, mistaking them for human beings, fled before
there was an opportunity to gather up the
plunder.”</p>

<p>This supposition was certainly the most plausible
of any yet entertained by Philip. Had the entire
colony been captured while at the ball, it would account
for the disorder of the dining-room, where
the tables had been prepared for the banquet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>With these gloomy ideas in his mind Philip no
longer dreamed of vengeance. He now believed
that escape from the island was impossible. Should
he succeed in holding the apes at bay it would only
serve to prolong life until the pirates returned, as
they undoubtedly would under the belief that there
were more inhabitants on the island.</p>

<p>“I shall live in this building as in a tomb as long
as it pleases God to preserve me,” he said to himself.
“And the treasure in the cave is of no more
value than if I had piled up the sands on the sea-shore.
To dream of leaving here is little less than
madness, surrounded and guarded as I am by those
who are a thousand times more crafty and cruel
than the Malay pirates.”</p>

<p>All hope was dead, and as does one who bids
farewell to this earth, expecting his stay on it is
numbered by hours, he moved about mechanically,
but yet instinctively trying to preserve longer his
wretched existence. As if his weapons were now
useless he replaced them in the closet, but examined
once more the fastenings of the doors and windows,
closing the shuttered loop-holes that he might not
see the sinister and menacing cordon of besiegers.</p>

<p>Then he descended to the floor below, determined
there to spend the last few hours of this most unnatural
drama. The darkness was preferable to
light when even the slight consolation of hope
must be denied, and he waited only for death, in
what form he did not speculate, to come.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>




<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE BEGINNING OF HOSTILITIES.</span></h2>

<p>It is difficult to describe the condition of mind
into which Philip fell when the hope which had
so long sustained him took flight.</p>

<p>As one in a dream, and hardly more conscious of
his movements than a sleeper, he remained during the
next five days in the lower story of the building.</p>

<p>A most unnatural and unhealthy condition of
mind it was; but another under the same circumstances
might have displayed even less fortitude.
He believed death to be inevitable in a very short
time, and that it was an equal chance whether the
blow would be dealt by pirates or apes; therefore,
with his sensibilities dulled by the conviction that
his days on earth were few, he passed them as does
the brute, and without thought save for the one supreme
moment.</p>

<p>Mechanically he ate, drank and slept, seeing
nothing save those objects which were revealed by
the rays of the candles, and it is more than probable
his mind would have given way under the continued
monotony had it not been for the rebellion his body
made against this unnatural mode of life.</p>

<p>His clothes, which had been literally torn to rags
during his painful experience in trying to amuse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
the apes and his subsequent flight through the
thicket, actually fell from his body, and since he
possessed neither needle nor thread he was almost in
a complete state of nudity.</p>

<p>The rainy season, which answers in the tropics to
our winter, had just commenced. The nights were
damp, even cold; and it was against this exposure
that his body rebelled. During the first two or
three days the deprivation of natural beverage
affected him but slightly. He drank frequently of
the different wines and liquors to be found in the
closet, and therefore was always thirsty. The
greater amount of spirits he consumed the more
necessary did water become, and as his body protested
against the cold, so did his stomach and brain
cry out against such stimulants.</p>

<p>That which at the end of the second day had
simply been an inconvenience became absolute
suffering as time wore on. His eyes were swollen
and bloodshot; his pulse beat with feverish rapidity,
his mouth felt parched and dry, and the throbbing
of his brain was like violent blows against the skull.
It needed but little to deprive him of reason, and
yet he realized not his own condition.</p>

<p>It was while suffering from that which was so
nearly akin to delirium that, hardly knowing what
he did he ascended the staircase, took once more the
weapons from the closet and approached the window.</p>

<p>The fever in his blood rendered him irresponsible,
and now a conflict was something to be desired. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
his mind came a vague idea that he would end it all
and die fighting. Better such an end than to yield
up his life amid the loneliness of that dwelling.</p>

<p>Piling all the ammunition under the window
which was situated directly beneath the tower, and
loading every musket and rifle, a savage glee took
possession of him as he opened the loop-hole.</p>

<p>That which met his gaze temporarily sobered him.
The fumes of the liquor were driven from his brain,
and he saw clearly the danger which menaced.</p>

<p>On the day when he descended to the kitchen
with the intention of remaining until death should
come to his release there had been perhaps two
hundred apes guarding the dwelling. As he looked
forth now, five times as many were to be seen. To
count them was impossible; they were as the sands
of the sea, and equally silent.</p>

<p>Five days previous these besiegers had gathered
only insignificant piles of stones. Now this rude
ammunition had increased to such an enormous
extent that it formed veritable hills, placed so close
one to the other that it was as if an army had been
throwing up breastworks, and behind them three
men each raised on the shoulders of the other could
hardly have looked over the top. The dwelling,
instead of commanding a view of the surrounding
country, was now so inclosed that he was forced to
lift his eyes in order to see the grinning faces which
were gazing down upon him. The house no longer
stood on an elevation, but in a valley formed by
these walls of projectiles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>Just within the edge of the woods, where was yet
an open space, two large apes were engaged in a
deadly struggle, and Philip watched them for a moment
with a sort of savage pleasure, as if delighting
in the brutal scene.</p>

<p>Then a delirium of fever seized him once more.
He was no longer a reasoning animal, but a brute
sunk to the level of those who held him captive.</p>

<p>Without questioning as to what might be gained
by such a course, he discharged both barrels of his
musket into the crowd of those who had gathered
around the combatants, and three fell at the first
discharge. Again and again he emptied his
weapons, mowing down long lines of apes, but
apparently increasing their numbers, for as one fell
a dozen sprung to fill his place in the line of battle
which was now formed.</p>

<p>In five minutes, where perhaps a hundred had
stood, half a thousand were gathered.</p>

<p>Neither were these new-comers idle. It was as if
the report of his weapon had been waited for as the
signal of a general assault, and in an instant the air
was filled with fragments of rocks and stones, until
one might have fancied a furious hailstorm was raging.
Pelting against the building on all sides came
the missiles, doing little damage at first; but it was
not possible such a frail structure could long withstand
the assault.</p>

<p>Amid the shower of stones were handfuls of sand,
as if the latter was thrown by weaker arms; and,
accompanied by grunts and shrieks of the besiegers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
the effect can hardly be described. It was deafening,
and at the same time horrible.</p>

<p>Maddened by continued drinking of liquor, and
also by the terrific din without, Philip kept up a
perfect fusillade, until the moment came when his
weapons were so choked and heated that it was
necessary to pause.</p>

<p>Not for an instant did the apes cease their attack,
however. It was as if this silence on the part of
the besieged gave them renewed courage, and the
splintering of wood from time to time told that
some timber had yielded to their repeated assaults.</p>

<p>One would have said that these animals were well
skilled in the art of war. They advanced by
platoons, discharging a volley and falling back to
get more supplies, while fresh troops advanced.</p>

<p>Much as a skillful general might do when his
enemy shows signs of weakening, Goliah appeared
on the scene at the moment Philip’s fusillade ceased,
and, urging his followers to greater exertions, flung
a heavy, jagged fragment of rock at the window
with such force that the shutter was splintered, the
pieces which fell inside knocking Philip to the floor.</p>

<p>This was the first evidence of what might be
accomplished by such a bombardment, and through
this rent in the wall came showers of stones, until
the room was partially filled.</p>

<p>Philip was dazed for the moment by the fragments
of wood; but he sprung to his feet on regaining
consciousness, and once more opened fire, this
time from another window. Such a fearful storm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
of projectiles rained into the room that he would
have been killed before one cartridge was exploded
had he attempted to fire through the breach.</p>

<p>He no longer heeded the condition of his weapons.
One musket was used until the danger of explosion
was so imminent as to make it apparent to his disordered
mind, and dropping the useless gun he
seized another, firing with accurate aim, but never
diminishing in the slightest the enemy’s vigor.</p>

<p>The second shutter gave way before the fierce assault.
He was wounded by the splinters of wood
and fragments of stone. His face was lacerated
and several teeth were broken. His hands were
bleeding, and the upper portion of his body was
bruised and swollen.</p>

<p>The ammunition was becoming exhausted, and he
saw with dismay that not only was it impossible to
vanquish the enemy unaided, but also that he could
not continue the battle a great many hours
longer.</p>

<p>Hundreds of cartridges had been used; the shells
were strewn so thickly about him that he was
forced now and then to stop and kick them away
in order to gain a foot-hold.</p>

<p>Before nightfall two of the muskets had burst in
his hands, fortunately without inflicting any serious
injury, and he understood that it was necessary to
cease hostilities on his side until the remainder of
the weapons could be cleaned.</p>

<p>It was when he arrived at this decision that the
shades of night began to fall, and never before, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
man, did the going down of the sun give more
pleasure.</p>

<p>Darkness settled over the island. The apes ceased
their bombardment, and victory was for the time
undecided.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, however, the apes were
really the conquerors, since the enemy whose ranks
can be continually reinforced must triumph in the
end were he a hundred times less clever and brave
than his adversary; therefore it is that in battle
“might makes right.”</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>




<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV.<br />
<span class="smaller">A METAMORPHOSIS.</span></h2>

<p>Until this night Philip had fancied that the
dwelling would serve him as an impregnable
fort; but the result of the first day’s battle showed
how idle was such belief. It was hardly probable
the building would withstand another attack, and
he who had flattered himself that he was safe as
long as he remained indoors understood how shelterless
he would be after four or five hours more of
stone-throwing.</p>

<p>The knowledge of such imminent danger had a
beneficial effect upon the solitary occupant of Captain
Seaworth’s house. It cleared the fumes of
liquor from his brain, as it were, and left him weaker
in body, but mentally better able to comprehend his
exact position.</p>

<p>Carrying his weapons, he descended to the kitchen
once more, and there the excitement brought on a
fever turn, with which came also despair. He was
like one in an ague-fit, and after the heat of the
melee had subsided—which was not until he had
partially cleaned his weapons with wine instead of
water—a cold chill took possession of him.</p>

<p>Now a covering of some sort became necessary.
It seemed as if he was literally freezing to death,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
and with a lighted candle in his hand he rushed
frantically upstairs, hoping to find draperies with
which to screen his almost naked body, or failing in
that, intending to use the light covering of the bed.</p>

<p>Ammunition had become as essential to success as
clothing, and again he searched feverishly around
the room.</p>

<p>It was while overhauling one of Captain Seaworth’s
chests that Philip placed his hands on a
thick fur which felt soft as silk.</p>

<p>Delighted at the discovery he examined it closely,
and found that it was the entire hide of an animal
similar to those by whom he was besieged. From
its enormous size he became convinced it was the
coat of the gigantic mandrill killed by the captain—the
same brute whose skeleton, hanging in the mimosas,
had caused him so much surprise as well as
fear.</p>

<p>With the exception of a slit in the stomach the
hide had been taken off entire, and, shrunken somewhat
during the process of drying, it fitted Philip as
well as if it were made by an expert furrier.</p>

<p>Through the opening in the front he inserted his
body, as does a boy who puts on one of those peculiar
night-gowns made to cover each limb; and in
order that none of the warmth so necessary just
then should escape, he laced up the aperture with
a piece of string. Pulling the top of the hide over
his head, he had cap, coat and trousers of the same
material, all fitting like a glove, and warm enough
to withstand the rigors of an Arctic winter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>When his toilet was completed he looked at himself
in the glass, but immediately drew back with a
cry of alarm.</p>

<p>His brown skin, thin cheeks and parched lips,
which allowed his teeth to be seen, his prominent
cheek-bones, disheveled hair, together with eyes
hollow and restless, because of the fever, caused him
to look exactly like the ape whose garment he was
wearing.</p>

<p>It would hardly be possible to imagine a more
striking resemblance, and Philip himself was decidedly
troubled. It seemed as if he had descended,
both in body and mind, to the level of his enemies.</p>

<p>There was warmth in this garment, however, and
with it came a return of the fever. At all events,
it is better to say his subsequent movements were
caused by the fire in his blood than to fancy for a
single moment that the skin of the animal had such
an effect as to make him leap over the chairs or
tables in the same fashion as its original owner
might have done.</p>

<p>He was transformed into an ape in appearance,
and one could fancy this had unsettled his mind, for
many moments elapsed before he resumed the bearing
of a human being.</p>

<p>Then he descended to the kitchen, spread for himself
a repast composed of delicacies which had become
distasteful, and forced himself to eat until the
generous food caused the fever to subside somewhat.</p>

<p>The sight of his fur-covered arms almost frightened
him, and not for all the treasure in the subterranean<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
chambers would he have taken another
glance at the glass, lest his own identity be forgotten
in the belief that he had become one of that species
in whose education he formerly felt so much interest.</p>

<p>His mind was a curious mixture of fancies and
realities, all so strangely interwoven that it seemed
more like some hideous nightmare than the events
of life.</p>

<p>Not until nearly daybreak did he fall into an uneasy
slumber, which brought with it representations
of every specimen of the monkey-tribe, and on
awakening shortly after sunrise he felt as weary as
if sleep had long been a stranger to his eyelids.</p>

<p>It was necessary he should be at his post of duty
when the battle was opened once more, as it undoubtedly
soon would be, and with his weapons in
but little better condition than on the previous day
he went into the room above, stationing himself at
the corner window opposite the one which had been
demolished.</p>

<p>This time it was the besiegers, not the besieged,
who began the attack. Philip had hardly opened
the loop-hole when showers of stones fell, and
before he had time even to discharge a weapon a
large portion of the front wall and roof collapsed
under the weight of missiles, thus contracting his
place of refuge to less than half its original size.</p>

<p>Realizing that he must check, if possible, this
furious attack, lest the building be utterly
demolished and he crushed to death amid the ruins,
Philip began to fire with the utmost rapidity. During<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
the next hour he sent shot after shot at intervals
of not more than ten or fifteen seconds, but with no
better result than before. It is true he could see an
ape fall at every discharge, but his enemies were so
numerous that the gaps were immediately closed
with soldierly precision, and when fifty rounds had
been fired it seemed as if the numbers of the
besiegers increased rather than diminished.</p>

<p>Now and then a crash could be heard, telling that
some portion of the building had fallen, and it
seemed hardly probable he would be able to continue
the struggle an hour longer.</p>

<p>Even though he might succeed in so far husbanding
his strength as to keep up the firing indefinitely,
his weapons would soon cease to be of service.
Already was he reduced to one musket, the barrel
of which was so hot as to burn his hands, and it was
only a question of a few moments before he would
be defenceless.</p>

<p>He could see Goliah leaping from point to point
as he urged his followers to greater exertions, and
never once remaining in one position long enough to
serve as a fair target.</p>

<p>The rocks fell like rain in a summer shower, and
at the expiration of a quarter of an hour the last
remaining musket was so choked as to be useless.
The entire front of the house gave way. The
floor of the chamber swayed to and fro like the
branches of a tree in a storm, and it was only by
clutching at the window-casings that he saved himself
from being precipitated into the road.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>He could feel the building crumbling beneath his
feet, and it now remained for him to accept one of
the two alternatives. He must stay where he was,
knowing he would soon be crushed under the fragments
of the dwelling, or leap into the midst of the
savage brutes who were maddened by thought of
victory, and there die like a man.</p>

<p>On a shelf near by was a dagger, perhaps the
very weapon the Malays had left sticking in the
sand, and beside it lay his revolver, which he had
discarded when the battle first began, believing it
too small to be of any real service.</p>

<p>These two he seized, one in each hand, and mentally
nerving himself for the death which he fancied
must come immediately, he leaped through the rent
in the walls, alighting on his feet in the road half a
dozen paces from the vindictive Goliah.</p>

<p>In his mind there was not the slightest thought
that it would be possible to escape a painful death.
His only idea was to die while fighting, rather than
submit to capture and such torture as the apes could
probably devise.</p>

<p>Therefore it is not to be wondered at that an
astonishment amounting almost to bewilderment
seized upon him when the army, instead of making
a deadly assault, dropped their weapons, drew back
with every show of respect and even terror, and
then bent before him as if trying to assume the most
humble positions.</p>

<p>The leaders of the troop, who a few moments
previous had been so eager to encompass his death,
now literally cringed before Philip like whipped
curs, and with Goliah at their head gathered
around, fawning and caressing, while Philip stood as
if stupefied; and in fact only that word would explain
his mental condition.</p>

<p>The entire army crouched around him, some licking
his hands, others his feet, and all showing in
every possible way delight and abasement. Not a
gesture of anger was made, and every head was
bowed in evident respect.</p>

<p>It was fully a quarter of an hour before the bewildered
Philip had so far gained the mastery over
himself as to form the slightest conjecture of the
reason for this sudden change in the behavior of his
enemies, and then like a flash of light came into his
mind the thought that in the mandrill’s skin he was
mistaken for the gigantic ape whom Captain Seaworth
had suspected was the leader of all the apes
on the island.</p>

<p>From the bearing of those who had so lately bent
every energy to kill him there could be no doubt
but that he was safe, and his salvation was due only
to the fact that in him the army recognized an ape,
or rather the king of apes.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE NEW KING.</span></h2>

<p>While Philip stood silent and motionless, trying
to realize all that the position of a leader
of apes might signify, and speculating as to whether
it would be possible for him to carry out the part
designated by his brute companions, the animals
were literally walking over each other in their
efforts to show allegiance or to give proof of joy at
his return.</p>

<p>Philip’s first official act was to study closely the
countenances of those nearest, to discover if they
were perplexed or suspicious because he did not answer
their chattering.</p>

<p>The owner of Philip’s skin must have been a
quiet sort of fellow and one who was not given to
conversation, for his delighted subjects appeared to
think there was nothing strange in this silence of
their king after so long an absence.</p>

<p>Goliah appeared to be the only member of the
party who was not delighted at the sudden turn
which affairs had taken; and this was but natural,
since it could hardly be expected that a despot will
“step down and out” from his high position without
showing some signs of sorrow at relinquishing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
his authority. He accepted the inevitable with remarkably
good grace, however, even going so far as
to seem pleased at seeing the rightful king come to
his own once more.</p>

<p>This was the source of no slight relief to Philip.
Had the big baboon attempted to incite a rebellion, it
is barely possible that he who had so suddenly discovered
himself a monarch would be deposed, for with
treason in the camp he would be at the mercy of
the conspirators, since, not understanding the language
of the realm, he could not employ spies, and
his downfall might be even more sudden than his
elevation.</p>

<p>But, as has been said, Goliah bore with wonderful
equanimity the loss of his crown, and at once
installed himself in the office of adviser or member
of the privy council, which position one of the slain
had probably held prior to the king’s sudden disappearance.</p>

<p>Understanding that not only his high dignities
but his life depended upon the naturalness with
which he wore the borrowed skin, Philip endeavored
to ape the apes, exerting himself to leap about in
the most fantastic manner, as he had seen Goliah do
during his reign, and, singular as it may seem, his
antics were greeted with the most vociferous applause.</p>

<p>The only difficulty he experienced in transforming
himself into a brute was his inability to wave
the tail back and forth, expressive of pleasure or
disapprobation, and his first edict was promulgated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
privately for his own benefit, to the effect that he
must never turn his back upon his courtiers.</p>

<p>It was fully two hours before the delighted throng
had finished showing their pleasure at the monarch’s
return, and then the crowd gave way sufficiently
for him to set out, accompanied by the courtiers
and a long train of attendants, to make a general
inspection of the one town in his kingdom.</p>

<p>In the hour of his prosperity—if one can be
called prosperous who has suddenly been transformed
into an ape—Philip did not forget the debt
of gratitude he owed the chimpanzee, but immediately
directed his steps toward the rear of the
buildings, where the unfortunate Ben Bolt still languished
behind prison-bars.</p>

<p>As the vast assembly arrived in front of the iron
cage on the floor of which lay the poor captive
whose only crime consisted in having incurred the
displeasure of the vicious Goliah, Alice, who was
trying to console the unfortunate chimpanzee as best
she could from the outside, darted back in affright,
believing the time had come when her mate was to
be sacrificed to the vengeance of the baboon.</p>

<p>Even she did not recognize the animal-trainer in
his new character; but she evidently had kindly remembrances
of him who formerly owned Philip’s
skin, for instead of continuing her flight she halted
at the edge of the thicket until a gesture from the
new king brought her to the bars of the cage once
more.</p>

<p>Philip lost no time in unfastening the bolts, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
reassuring the captive as best he could by dumb
show, led him forth to where Alice stood, awaiting
in painful uncertainty the result of this sudden
change of affairs.</p>

<p>Goliah understood even before the chimpanzee
did that they were free to go wheresoever they
pleased, and he gave, vent to low cries of rage and
despair as he saw the two walk away paw in paw,
the happiest-looking monkeys in the kingdom.</p>

<p>Even then the deposed ruler did not show the
least sign of insubordination; he accepted what
was to him the inevitable with becoming resignation,
save for the hoarse cries he uttered.</p>

<p>It is not to be wondered at that after this simple
act of justice had been done, Philip was wholly at a
loss to know how to comport himself in accordance
with his dignity. To move even the short distance
of a yard without his numerous train of followers
was impossible. His life had been spared only at
the expense of becoming thoroughly an ape, and it
was necessary to play well the part assigned him,
until such time as friendly members of his own race
should land upon the island.</p>

<p>The thought that Captain Seaworth might succeed
in regaining his liberty and return with the
colonists was the only thing that sustained him in
this trying position. With hands clasped behind his
back in a very un-apish attitude, he walked slowly
toward his late place of refuge, followed by thousands
of his monkey-subjects, all moving as if
plunged in the deepest reflection.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>Arriving at the ruins of the building he seated
himself upon the fragments of some timber, trying
to decide what his future course of action should be,
and the crowd gathered silently around with the
utmost show of respect.</p>

<p>While sitting here it was but natural that Philip’s
thoughts should revert to the battle so lately and
singularly ended, and he looked about him for the
bodies of the slain.</p>

<p>Surely hundreds had fallen under his well-directed
and continuous fire, but yet not a single corpse was
to be seen. Search with his eyes where he would, it
was as if the besiegers had suffered no loss whatever;
and the reason for such a state of affairs he was
not long in divining.</p>

<p>The apes had buried their comrades!</p>

<p>This newly-acquired knowledge led up to a subject
which troubled Philip seriously. If any of his
devoted followers should chance to discover the
skeleton hanging in the mimosas, would they not
recognize it as the frame of their former king, and
thus be in a position to brand the present monarch
as an impostor? Inasmuch as all their dead were
consigned to the earth, it would be known at once
that this ape had been killed before the appearance
of the shipwrecked youth on the island. He already
had sufficient proof of their reasoning powers
to believe they would readily divine the meaning
of the sinister mimosa fruit, more especially
since it undoubtedly hung in the same thicket where
they saw their king fall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>It was necessary to put an end to this possible
embarrassment at the very beginning of his reign;
but how could it be done? One may think it would
be a simple matter to bury the bones near where
they were now hanging. Such a plan could indeed
have been carried into execution with the greatest
facility when Philip was the shipwrecked animal-trainer;
but now that he had become king of the
island, and was surrounded by hundreds of followers,
it was an extremely difficult project, since upon
the secrecy of the movement depended its success.</p>

<p>“At all events,” Philip said to himself, “it is useless
for me to think of stealing away unobserved
just now. I must await an opportunity, and trust
to the chapter of accidents that my predecessor’s
bones may not be discovered meanwhile.”</p>

<p>As he thus put from his mind this unpleasant contingency,
the desire for water, which had been so
intense during the past five days, returned with redoubled
force, and for the first time did his kingly
dignity seem a boon. Now he could quench his
thirst with what he pleased, and his followers might
exhaust the cupboard of its supply of liquor without
his being tempted to partake of a single drop.</p>

<p>Making his way with difficulty through the ruined
building he proceeded to the court-yard, and, kneeling
at the fountain of crystal water, drank until it
seemed as if his thirst would never be satiated,
while his subjects, deeming it their duty to do as he
did, filled themselves with the cool beverage at imminent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
danger of bursting, through their excess of
loyal devotion.</p>

<p>After this had been done Philip felt the need of
rest, and, lying on the greensward under shelter of
the awning, prepared to go to sleep.</p>

<p>It was a singular spectacle that met his gaze as he
raised himself on one elbow to make sure the apes
had not found their way into the kitchen. The entire
court-yard and veranda were covered with the
recumbent forms of the monkeys, none of whom
were probably very sleepy, but all bent on following
their king’s example; and in attempting to do this
it was necessary to pile themselves on top of each
other like sardines in a box.</p>

<p>Although the bed was large it was uncomfortably
full, and the unpleasant thought came into Philip’s
mind that while remaining upon the island he would
probably have the same number of bedfellows every
night.</p>

<p>The strangeness of the situation, however, did not
prevent him from closing his eyes in slumber, and
this blissful unconsciousness might have continued
until daybreak had it not been for a decided interruption
in the shape of a tropical tempest, which
came upon them in all its fury just before midnight.</p>

<p>In an instant the court-yard was a scene of the
greatest confusion as the crowd of apes tried to
gain shelter in the adjoining buildings, and during
the confusion the king’s dignity was completely
forgotten.</p>

<p>Even had the main building been intact it would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
not have sufficed to shelter one-fourth of the party,
and, half-ruined as it was, only comparatively few
could find in it a refuge from the rain which poured
down in torrents.</p>

<p>As a matter of course this obliged the majority of
the troop to flee toward the other cottages, and they
ran in every direction with apparently not a thought
of their recently-returned king. There was no one,
however insignificant, who would pause in that tempest
to do homage to the monarch, and in a very
few seconds the court-yard was so nearly deserted
that the king was virtually alone.</p>

<p>This was the opportunity for which Philip had
longed, and, perhaps fortunately for him, it had
come thus quickly. Now he could steal away unobserved,
and bury what might not inaptly be termed
his own bones.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>




<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI.<br />
<span class="smaller">A KINGLY GRAVE-DIGGER.</span></h2>

<p>Philip had no very clear idea of where the
skeleton was hanging. As is already known, he
had accidentally come upon it during his journey
from the beach; therefore the mimosas with the sinister-looking
fruit were in a southerly direction from
the village, but of more than that he was ignorant.</p>

<p>To find this spot in the night, and during the violent
tempest, seemed an impossible task; but yet it
must be attempted despite every danger, because
such an opportunity might not present itself again
for many days.</p>

<p>He made his way out through the ruined building,
while his followers scampered in every direction to
shelter their bodies from the rain (for a monkey is
proverbially afraid of water), and crossed the road
into the thicket without being perceived by any of
the startled crowd.</p>

<p>There was not the slightest danger of meeting
with one of his subjects during the journey unless
the tempest should cease suddenly and Goliah send
messengers in search of him; therefore he walked
fearlessly forward after stopping behind the breastworks
thrown up during the battle to arm himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
with a stout stick, which would serve as a shovel in
the task of grave-digging.</p>

<p>The rain descended in torrents. The wind howled
and shrieked among the trees, bending them almost
to the earth, or here and there uprooting some sturdy
fellow who refused to bow his crest before the
storm, while fragments of branches, falling in
every direction, threatened destruction to the reckless
traveler. The lightning-flashes which darted
across the entire horizon, illuminating during a few
seconds the thicket as with the glare of the noonday
sun, served oftentimes to disclose danger in his
path, and it was only from the frequency of these
bolts of light that he was enabled to make his way
with any knowledge of direction.</p>

<p>His own skin was dry, although that of his assumed
character was heavy with water, and, save
for the fatigue of rapid walking, he was even more
comfortable than he would have been in a close
room surrounded by his animal followers. The
knowledge that he had left the apes behind served
to arouse a feeling of exultation, and he bounded
forward like a prisoner who suddenly sees the road
to liberty open before him when he had fancied his
term of confinement not yet half ended.</p>

<p>Each time the electric flash came he looked
around eagerly in search of the mimosas, and more
than once did he mistakenly believe he had arrived
at the end of his journey.</p>

<p>The storm was still raging furiously when he
finally found that for which he sought.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>Fully two minutes had passed without lightning,
and then, as a terrific peal of thunder was followed
by a violent blaze, he saw directly before him, swaying
to and fro in the wind, the bones of himself—or
of his predecessor, whichever may be the correct
term.</p>

<p>As a certain well-known author has said: “Man
has three distinct characters. Himself as God
knows him, himself as his fellows know him, and
himself as he knows himself.” It was this second
character which Philip wished to hide, and, under
the above proposition, could rightfully be said to be
burying his own skeleton.</p>

<p>To dig a grave with a sharpened stick as his only
tool was by no means an easy task, since, owing to
the enormous size of the mandrill Captain Seaworth
had killed, it was necessary to make the excavation
fully seven feet long.</p>

<p>He worked, however, as men will when they
know their lives depend upon the effort. He threw
aside the dark loam with feverish haste, regardless
alike of the pitiless rain and the hurtling branches,
until, just as the storm ceased and the moon peeped
out from among the flying clouds as if for no other
purpose than to tint the rattling bones with a most
unearthly radiance, the grave was made, and the
time had come when the skeleton must be cut down
from the branches.</p>

<p>As a matter of course the former king of the
island had no trousers pockets, therefore Philip was
without a knife; but so strong is instinct that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
attempted several times to insert his hand into the
outer skin of his leg before realizing that his new
clothes contained no convenient receptacle for tools.
The rope by which the skeleton had been suspended
was strong and resisted all his efforts to break it.
It was necessary to ascend the tree and untie the
halter, after which the well-dried anatomy fell to
the ground with a clatter such as the end-man in a
minstrel-show makes when he wishes to excite the
greatest possible applause.</p>

<p>It was necessary to work now with the utmost
haste, for, the tempest having ceased, it was more
than probable his followers would soon come in pursuit,
and Philip interred his skeleton with all possible
speed, trampling the earth down until convinced
that only the most careful scrutiny could
reveal his secret.</p>

<p>Then he retraced his steps as best he could; but
more than once did he deviate from the proper
course, and the result of these involuntary detours
was that day had already begun to break when he
arrived within sight of the village.</p>

<p>Here was the loyalty of his subjects made manifest
once more. Every individual ape had been
looking for his king, occupying the piles of stones or
roofs of houses as points of vantage, and when
Philip appeared from the thicket a howl of joy
went up which seemed to shake the very island.</p>

<p>During five hours the animal-trainer had been a
man, but now he was an ape again, so to remain
until rescuers should arrive or he be tempted to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
steal out once more under the friendly cover of a
tempest.</p>

<p>Of course the first step which either king or
peasant would naturally take after morning dawned
was to procure breakfast, and Philip realized how
necessary such a course was from the faintness
which seized upon him after his arduous labors.</p>

<p>To enter the kitchen and there satisfy his
hunger would be to squander all the provisions
stored in the cupboards, for his subjects would make
short work of Captain Seaworth’s dainties. Therefore,
with a view of saving the stock for an emergency,
Philip led the way, followed by hundreds of
grinning, chattering, frolicsome monkeys, to the
banana plantation, where all were soon busily engaged
hunting for the yellow fruit.</p>

<p>It was Goliah himself who assumed the task of
providing the king with food, and when the party
had eaten their fill Philip led them back to the village,
where for some moments he stood undecided
as to how he should further comport himself.</p>

<p>To roam about the forest with such a band might
be to excite the gravest suspicions in the minds of
his subjects because of his inability to climb a tree
or to swing himself from the branches by the aid of
his tail; therefore it was necessary he should, so far
as possible, remain in the settlement.</p>

<p>The sight of the ruined buildings, in front of
which were the enormous piles of stones thrown up
as breastworks, gave him a desire to see these
habitations restored to their former appearance, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
the thought came that it would not be a long task
to raise houses on the same plan, with walls formed
of the ammunition gathered by the apes.</p>

<p>It hardly seemed probable the long-tailed subjects
could be made to act the part of builders, but they
would serve to carry the materials from one point to
another, and he resolved to set about the work of
reconstructing the settlement as a pleasant and
profitable way of spending his time.</p>

<p>To this end he began to drag away the splintered
timbers, and instantly a thousand pairs of hands
were at work following his example, until all the
debris had been removed from the proposed site of
the building. That which would have required a
week of his time was done in an hour, and the
amateur architect understood that his labors might
yet be crowned with success.</p>

<p>Then he placed some of the larger stones on such
a line as he intended the walls should be erected
upon. Instantly every ape on the island was seized
with a mania for building, laboring with such a will
that it required all his efforts to restrain what was
misdirected zeal, otherwise a wall like that of China
might have been put up, provided there had been
sufficient materials at hand.</p>

<p>It was necessary he should find something which
would serve as mortar; and to that end, as soon as
he could control his too willing subjects he searched
the store-houses until to his great joy he found at
least twenty barrels of plaster, which Captain Seaworth
had brought in case it might be needed for
just such a purpose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>To have these heavy barrels conveyed to the
scene of operations it was only necessary for Philip
to roll one, when the whole twenty came out like
horses on a race-track; and as he began to open the
plaster and mix it with water, so did they.</p>

<p>Seized with a rage for building, they made mortar,
broke stone, ran here and there, and assisted Philip
until the entire party were whitened with plaster
from the ends of their flattened noses to their toes,
causing them to look like veritable workmen with
white over-garments; but, unlike other workmen,
they neither insisted that eight hours made up a
full day’s work, nor did they idle away valuable
time in frivolous conversation.</p>

<p>Before the day was half spent Philip began to experience
the disagreeable consequences of his midnight
journey in the rain. His predecessor’s hide
had been thoroughly soaked during the labor of
grave-digging, and now that the sun sent down his
hottest rays the skin began to shrink, aided by the
heat of his body and the warmth of the atmosphere,
until it inclosed him as if in a case of iron. Struggle
as he might, it was impossible to stretch the
stout hide by any motion of his body, and the cold
perspiration gathered on his forehead as he realized
what the position of affairs would be in case the
tightly-fitting garment should burst asunder.</p>

<p>He no longer dared to make any movement, but
stood erect with an expression of anxiety on his
face; and, true to their habits of mimicry, his
subjects did the same until Philip could not resist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
the inclination to laugh aloud as the thought presented
itself that it would be ridiculous, indeed, if
every member of the party were also waiting with
the same anxiety to ascertain whether or no his own
skin was about to split.</p>

<p>When he burst forth in uncontrollable laughter
the entire army of laborers did the same until the
air resounded with their cries, and once more was
Philip forced to exercise the greatest caution lest
even his own mirth should hasten the catastrophe he
so greatly feared.</p>

<p>Fortunately, however, his predecessor’s hide was
now fully shrunken, and although it fitted him quite
as tightly as did his own skin, he had every reason
to believe it would remain intact unless he should
be so careless as to make some violent exertion.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>




<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXVII">CHAPTER XXVII.<br />
<span class="smaller">A SERIOUS ACCIDENT.</span></h2>

<p>It was only during such times as the work
could be pursued that Philip had any relief of
mind, despite his kingly dignities. When, by example,
he intimated that the labors of the day
might cease, his subjects expected him to play the
part of ape as heartily as they had enacted the role
of laborers, and in order to preserve his life he was
forced to comply with these wishes.</p>

<p>Holding a court-martial, for the purpose of trying
and sentencing alleged offenders, was the greatest
delight of the long-tailed inhabitants, and once each
day Philip was obliged to sit in solemn state, surrounded
by his lieutenants, while the number of
supposed culprits brought before him was always
sufficient to furnish the brute dignitaries with the
spectacle of a wholesale flogging.</p>

<p>If any of the party were found idle during working-hours
they were certain of being brought up for
judgment, and this fact probably accounted for the
great zeal displayed whenever an example was set
before them.</p>

<p>At these mock trials Philip remained silent, since
it would have been impossible for his subjects to understand
any decision he might render; and Goliah<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
took upon himself the duties of judge, looking up
now and then at the king, as if to make certain he
was not assuming too much power.</p>

<p>After the judicial session was ended the monkeys
would separate, forming bands of two or three hundred,
each to go in search of food, and during such
excursions Philip oftentimes found an opportunity
to gain the kitchen unobserved, thus being able to
vary the ordinary bill of fare by some of the
dainties which had been so distasteful while he was
a prisoner in the building. Never once, however,
was he tempted to drink any of the wine. The remembrance
of the days when he so ardently wished
for water, but was unable to procure it, taught him
the strictest temperance principles.</p>

<p>Every morning the apes held what might be
called a grand military review, the entire body
marching in front of the building occupied by their
king. Philip, and those who attached themselves to
his person as a sort of body-guard or staff, reviewed
the troops with the utmost gravity, after which
each ape executed marvelous monkey-maneuvers in
the shape of ground and lofty tumbling, in which it
was expected the king would take an active part.</p>

<p>It was at the first of these parades that Philip
understood what was demanded of a monarch.
After the main body of the party had turned somersaults
or handsprings all eyes were directed at him,
and words were not needed to let him know he
should perform the same antics.</p>

<p>This opportunity of allowing the king to display<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
his agility was never lost, and after the first exhibition
Philip looked forward with fear and trembling
to the moment when he must, before the assembled
army, go through such contortions as would have
put a professional acrobat to shame.</p>

<p>His method of life, as well as his costume, fitted
him to a certain extent for these extraordinary antics,
and while he did not succeed in performing
them with the skill and agility displayed by his subjects,
there were plenty of flatterers near at hand
to lavish praise upon him as if he had outdone them
all.</p>

<p>And now must be told that which may seem improbable.</p>

<p>Eager for labor, because it brought him relief
from close communication with his followers, Philip
set systematically at work, not only repairing the
buildings, but laying out roads from one side of the
island to the other; and this he accomplished with
no more assistance than that afforded by the long-tailed
inhabitants.</p>

<p>In less than one month the buildings which had
been destroyed were rebuilt in the most substantial
manner with walls of stone. Two or three additional
dwellings were constructed later, and four
splendid roads running north, south, east and west,
from the village to the sea, were opened.</p>

<p>That which would have taken a small army of
laborers many months to accomplish was completed
by the apes in a little more than three weeks. It
was only necessary for Philip to begin felling trees<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
on the right and left of the four lines representing
the routes to be opened through the thicket, when
hundreds of pairs of hands were at work pulling up
the underbrush, tearing down shrubs, and chopping
at the tree-trunks with as many axes as could be
found in the store-room.</p>

<p>During this work in the forest Philip had ample
opportunity of noting the immense number and
variety of spiders and lizards which were to be
found on the island.</p>

<p>It was a positive pleasure for him to watch the
little jumping spiders, which were of such brilliant
hue that they looked like animated gems as they
sprang from bough to bough. The web-spinning
species were not only very numerous, but caused the
greatest annoyance. They stretched their webs
from one tree to another at such a height as to come
in contact with a man’s chin, and the threads were
so strong and glutinous as to require no slight
amount of trouble to free one’s self from them.
These fellows were fully two inches long, with yellow
spots on their brown bodies, which gave them a
very disagreeable appearance.</p>

<p>The apes paid little or no attention to these pests;
but Philip could never conquer his aversion to the
fat-bellied insects, and more than once did he make
a long detour rather than run the risk of an encounter.</p>

<p>As for the lizards, it seemed as if every bush was
alive with them. They were of all shades—green,
gray, brown and black; and even Goliah, who delighted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
in cruelty, never so much as harmed one of
these active little hunters, all of whom were busily
engaged catching the flies and mosquitoes, for without
such a check to the increase of insect-life the
island would speedily have become uninhabitable.</p>

<p>The work was carried steadily forward, however,
despite all annoyances, and in three weeks from the
time Philip Garland became king of the apes it was
possible to sit in the rebuilt tower of the principal
dwelling and view the sea from four different points.
Therefore, in case a vessel approached the island the
king would have such timely notice of her coming
that any signal might be made. It would simply be
necessary to start a small fire on the beach to have
it built to the height of a mountain by the industrious
apes.</p>

<p>Only in the hope of relief coming from the sea
did Philip succeed in nerving himself to play the
part of a brute. If he could have had a companion
with whom to converse, his position would have lost
many horrors; but to be surrounded by apes was
worse than being alone, and, next to the arrival of
human beings, perfect solitude was the greatest
boon which could have been granted him.</p>

<p>During the labor of road-making Philip noticed
that now and then a party of apes would leave the
working portion of the army and absent themselves
two or three hours, bringing at the end of that time
what appeared, both from shape and size, to be
hens’ eggs. These were evidently considered a
great delicacy by the apes, and the searchers invariably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
handed one to the king and each of his officers
before partaking themselves.</p>

<p>To make any attempt at cooking them would
have given the apes the idea of building innumerable
small fires, which might soon have consumed all
the vegetation on the island, and Philip ate his raw,
as did the others. He fancied that some of the
colonists’ poultry might have escaped destruction,
and so eager was he to learn where this article of
food could be found that on seeing a certain number
of apes abandon their labors, under Goliah’s
direction, he followed. The party went directly to
the sea-shore, and there, just above high-water mark,
where a turtle would naturally make her nest, were
found little piles of sand, in each of which was a
single egg.</p>

<p>It was some time before Philip learned that these
tiny hills were the nests of a bird known to naturalists
as the “Maleo.”</p>

<p>A few days later he saw a glossy black and white
bird with helmeted head and elevated tail—not
unlike a common fowl, except that the bonnet and
the tubercles at the nostrils were longer—scraping
the sand into little mounds, and he knew the rare
species was before him.</p>

<p>Some months subsequent to this Philip learned
that after the maleo thus deposits her eggs she follows
the example of the turtle, and pays no further
attention to her nest. The sun does the work of
maternity, and the young chicks are able to take
care of themselves on emerging from the shell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>When all the contemplated work had been
finished, Philip was at a loss to know how he should
employ the large number of his subjects, in order to
free himself as much as possible from their fawning
companionship.</p>

<p>He would have built an observatory on the summit
of the extinct volcano but for the fact that the
supply of plaster had already been used in remodeling
the buildings, and it was impossible to quarry
rocks of such size that they would be held together
by their own weight.</p>

<p>The readiness with which his subjects copied
every movement caused him to believe it might be
possible in the near future, unaided by human
beings, to continue the work already begun on the
plantation—provided, of course, he was not molested
by the pirates. This idea came into his mind one
day when they were near the base of the volcanic
mountain, and he saw what at first glance appeared
to be a peach-tree.</p>

<p>It was from twenty to thirty feet high, with
glossy green leaves, and bearing small, yellowish
flowers at the same time that ripe fruit, not unlike
a peach in size and color, hung upon its branches.</p>

<p>Up to this moment he had supposed an orange
was the only tree which blossomed while the fruit
was ripening, and this singular fact showed him the
mistake made in believing it to be a peach-tree.</p>

<p>Picking one of these luscious-looking apples, he
found it of a tough, fleshy consistency, partially
split open, and showing within a dark brown nut
covered with crimson mace. It was a nutmeg.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>As Philip well knew, the Dutch Government had
relinquished its monopoly of the nutmeg trade in
these seas, and he speculated, despite the amount of
gold stored in the cavern, whether it would not be
possible, with the aid of his long-tailed subjects, to
make of this fruitful island one vast plantation of
nutmegs, which would be a source of wealth greater
even than the bed of the stream could produce.</p>

<p>Although king of apes, he had the natural desire
of man to increase his possessions, and for a time
his fancy painted most gorgeous and alluring pictures
of what might be done if the energies of the
monkeys could be directed into the proper channel.</p>

<p>It was only when he realized the mischievous
propensities of the apes that he decided against this
pleasant dream. It was hardly probable he could restrain
them from destroying even fruit which was
not palatable; and he finally confessed to himself,
with a sigh, that however absolute his power, any
attempt to change the nature of his subjects would
be useless.</p>

<p>During the one day of rest in which he allowed
his followers to indulge he had been forced to make
such a display of his supposed apish powers as thoroughly
exhausted him, and, as the only means of
utilizing the superfluous energies of the army, he set
about exploring more carefully the island.</p>

<p>As may be supposed, his first step was to examine
the little harbor where the pirates had left their
sinister warning and in which the Reynard had
been anchored. This was done in the hope of discovering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
something that would show under what circumstances
the colonists had embarked.</p>

<p>So far as gaining information was concerned he
succeeded; but it was anything rather than satisfactory.</p>

<p>Two buoys floating on the water showed that the
anchor had not been weighed. The cables were
slipped when the Reynard sailed, and this fact convinced
Philip that the pirates had left the bay with
all possible speed, believing the apes were reinforcements
of men.</p>

<p>This confirmation of his previous theories was a
sad blow to the lonely youth, who had secretly hoped
he might have arrived at a false conclusion when
first studying the matter; but it was not long he
mourned because of his friends’ untimely fate, for
before that day came to an end he had grave cause
for fear concerning his own immediate safety.</p>

<p>It was on his return from the journey to the sea-shore
that Philip had an opportunity of seeing how
wonderfully Nature provides for the wants of man.</p>

<p>He, accompanied by Goliah and followed by the
entire army, marched through the dense thickets,
where not one breath from the sea could penetrate
to dispel the stifling heat, until the desire for water
was almost overpowering. In the hope that the
huge baboon might know of a spring near by, Philip
gave evidence of intolerable thirst by pointing to
his mouth and making gestures as if drinking.</p>

<p>Goliah was equal to the emergency. Walking on
a few paces he stopped before a half-vine, half-shrub,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
which partially clung to the trunk of a tree and
bore huge, bulb-like flowers, shaped something after
the fashion of a pitcher. At the top was a petal
which covered an aperture capable of holding at
least half a pint; and tearing this off, the baboon
presented to his king a flagon of water which, although
slightly warm, was as palatable as if it had
just been taken from a spring.</p>

<p>This was Philip’s first introduction to the “pitcher-plant,”
and many times afterward did he quench his
thirst from these natural reservoirs.</p>

<p>The exploring party returned to the village early
in the afternoon. The king, wearied by the long
walk, seated himself near the veranda of the royal
residence, while Goliah, arrogating to himself the
high office of commander-in-chief, called out the
troops for a second review.</p>

<p>Philip could not refuse to witness the evolutions
nor to take part himself, and his fatigue was so great
that he was even more awkward than usual.</p>

<p>While cutting the most solemn caper, which was
accepted by the apes as a formal military salute,
he heard a slight noise immediately in the rear, and
an instant later the loosening of his single garment
of skin told what a disaster had befallen him.</p>

<p>The hide was split at that place where it had been
most used by its former owner as well as by Philip,
and unless it should be possible to regain the dwelling
without turning his back to the troops the most
disastrous consequences might ensue.</p>

<p>Beads of perspiration stood on Philip’s brow as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
he retreated to a gigantic bamboo, where it was possible
to hide temporarily what the apes might have
considered something more than an accident; and
during the remainder of the review he stood stiff
and upright, while his staff-officers gazed at him in
astonishment which was not mute, because of the
chattering they indulged in among themselves.</p>

<p>Philip understood that the first breath of suspicion
had fallen upon him, and instinctively he looked
around for a weapon, knowing that Goliah would
not be slow to take advantage of any opportunity
to regain the crown.</p>

<p>A stout piece of bamboo, which had been used
during the parade in lieu of a sword by one of the
officers, lay upon the ground where Philip could
reach it without exposing the fracture in his garments,
and seizing this he stood on guard, fully determined
to defend himself, even to the death, in
case his counselors or Goliah should insist on his
taking part in the maneuvers. That he would fall
a victim to their wrath the instant the deception was
made known by the rent was unquestionable; but
his kingly dignity might prevent the greater number
of his subjects from crowding too near.</p>

<p>In a suspiciously friendly manner Goliah motioned
him, when the troops were drawn up for the royal
salute, to advance and go through the ridiculous
antics which he had formerly executed on such occasions.</p>

<p>Philip placed his hand on his head, and then on
his stomach, as if to show that he was suffering from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
pain. Although the other members of his privy
counsel appeared satisfied with such an explanation,
the huge baboon displayed the most lively curiosity.
He walked entirely around the king and the tree
against which the latter leaned, but at a respectful
distance, and then, returning, once more invited the
monarch to salute the soldiers.</p>

<p>Again was the pantomime repeated, and, understanding
this controversy could not long continue,
Philip motioned for the troops to resume their
march. He was well aware that because of Goliah’s
maneuvres very many had grown distrustful;
but it was something which could not have been
prevented, and his safety lay in reaching the house.</p>

<p>Owing to Goliah’s interference, however, the parade
was not dismissed as quickly as under other
and more pleasant circumstances. The troops
marched and countermarched, directed by the baboon,
until it seemed to the king, whose royal robe was
shrinking rapidly, that the pageant would never end.</p>

<p>The fifteen minutes which passed after his refusal
to salute seemed like so many hours; but the
soldiers were finally dismissed, and by a series
of the most extraordinary maneuvers Philip
succeeded in reaching the veranda of his dwelling
hardly more alive than dead, while clustered around
him, with anxiety or curiosity written on every
face, was a vast throng of apes, foremost among
whom stood Goliah, glaring in the most suspicious
manner, as if he fully understood the cause of the
king’s discomfiture.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>




<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXVIII">CHAPTER XXVIII.<br />
<span class="smaller">A ROYAL INVALID.</span></h2>

<p>The king of the apes was a voluntary prisoner
for a second time.</p>

<p>On gaining the building he shut the door in the
faces of his anxious and suspicious subjects and betook
himself once more to the second-story room,
from the windows of which he had previously
waged battle against the apes.</p>

<p>This apartment, like all others in the house, had
been remodeled, and, thanks to the energy of his subjects,
was in a better condition to withstand a siege
than when he first entered it. During all his labor
he had kept ever in mind the thought that at some
future time it might be necessary to have a place of
refuge, and to this end he restored the rooms to
their original condition and location, thus giving him,
as before, free range from the kitchen to what had
been Captain Seaworth’s office.</p>

<p>It is true the doors were no stronger than before,
and should the apes select either one of them as a
distinct point of attack, it might soon be battered
down. Against such an event he could take no
precautions, but trusted that, should another battle
ensue, the missiles would be thrown with the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
absence of studied aim as had been previously displayed.</p>

<p>Arriving in this corner apartment, Philip threw
himself in Captain Seaworth’s chair disheartened
and almost weary of life, even though he was trying
to devise some plan for prolonging it.</p>

<p>Without having recourse to a mirror, he knew
exactly how large was the rent in his predecessor’s
skin and the difficulties he would have in repairing
it. Had it been possible to present himself boldly
before his subjects he might have searched in the
other houses of the village and probably found
needles and thread to repair the damage; but now
that he could show no more than his face, such an
opportunity for benefiting himself was out of the
question.</p>

<p>Mechanically he looked about him, although every
article in the room was familiar, and perhaps he had
opened the desk for at least the twentieth time,
when his eyes fell upon a piece of string.</p>

<p>It was what he most needed, and with it the rent
made by “envious fortune” might possibly be repaired.</p>

<p>Taking off the hide carefully and with considerable
difficulty, he found that it had been split from
just below the jointure of the tail to a distance of
fully twelve inches straight up the back, and of
course in that particular place his body would serve
to make the opening greater.</p>

<p>It was necessary to close it as nearly as possible,
and with a splinter of wood as an awl with which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
to puncture the hide, he finally succeeded in lacing
it up like a shoe.</p>

<p>The job was anything rather than satisfactory.
The nearest-sighted ape on the island would have
perceived at once that there was something the matter
with the king’s back, and so familiar were
Philip’s subjects with their monarch, there could be
no question about their immediately investigating
the cause of his singular appearance. Once curiosity
was aroused in this direction the secret must be exposed
within a very few moments, and he knew that
his life would be spared only so long as he succeeded
in keeping the apes at a proper distance.</p>

<p>One can readily imagine his condition of mind
when he put on, probably for the last time, the dress
of skin which had brought him such questionable
honors and might now prove to be the immediate
cause of his death. He could well say “Uneasy
lies the head that wears a crown” when only the
face should be seen by the subjects.</p>

<p>Goliah’s suspicions were undoubtedly aroused, and
beyond a question he would be the first, under the
guise of excessive loyalty, to discover why the military
review had been brought to such an abrupt
termination. Therefore Philip understood that
unless he could remain in a sitting posture during
the balance of his reign, discovery of his false
character was certain, and also that under no circumstances
must his followers be allowed to approach
him.</p>

<p>The entire night was passed in these gloomy reflections,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
and when the first gray light of dawn
appeared in the sky the chattering of apes under his
window told Philip that his followers had come to
learn the cause of his sudden indisposition.</p>

<p>That they would remain until he showed himself
was absolutely positive, and without opening the
door he stepped from the window to the balcony as
a great howl of joy went up from the assembled
throng. They danced and cut capers as if imploring
the king to come down, and at the risk of disarranging
his very tender hide he was obliged to
show them many a royal caper before their anxious
solicitude could be stilled in the slightest degree.</p>

<p>Even after he had executed these dangerous
maneuvers, for fully half an hour did they refuse to
be satisfied, and he had good reason to deplore what
probably no other king ever did—the intense affection
of his subjects.</p>

<p>Now and then some very zealous monkey clambered
up on the balcony to make sure the monarch
was not deceiving them as to the state of his health,
but at a gesture from him the animal would leap
back among the crowd; and when Philip felt certain
the lacing of his hide could no longer withstand the
strain he retreated into the room, taking good care
to close the window behind him.</p>

<p>That this voluntary imprisonment could not be
continued many days he understood before another
hour passed. The number of those who were eager
to ascertain the exact condition of their monarch’s
health increased each moment, and in the absence of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
a court physician who could issue regular bulletins
regarding the patient it was necessary Philip should
show himself on the balcony several times during
the afternoon, otherwise the building might have
been attacked again.</p>

<p>As a matter of course, he was forced on every
occasion to go through the apish capers which were
supposed to display affection for his subjects, and
each time a warning rip from behind told that his
gestures of love must be moderated, otherwise his
hide and his reign would soon be at an end.</p>

<p>During this alternate appearance and disappearance
Goliah remained seated among the feathery
branches of a palm which grew directly in front of
the building, and one could almost fancy he was taking
notes, so carefully did he watch every movement
of the king, or so eagerly did he peer around
when his majesty retreated.</p>

<p>It was hardly to be supposed that the huge
baboon would exert himself to prolong a reign
which had begun with his own discomfiture, and on
his last appearance Philip realized that to again
leave the building would be to give Goliah an opportunity
of pursuing his investigations to a successful
termination.</p>

<p>To repel an attack was no longer possible. During
the last battle the ammunition had been so far
exhausted that not more than twenty cartridges and
one not very serviceable weapon was left. Therefore
from force of arms Philip could expect nothing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>That evening the animal-trainer who was playing
the part of king in Apeland made one more attempt
to restore the symbol of his royalty to its former
condition. With infinite care he laced and relaced
the rent until he flattered himself it was nearly as
well concealed as if done by the most skillful tailor,
and putting it on again, decided that he might trust
himself even in the presence of Goliah.</p>

<p>His mind was so nearly at ease that he ate a
hearty supper from the store of provisions in the
kitchen pantry and laid himself down to rest, believing
he had secured a yet longer lease to the
throne of apedom.</p>

<p>Alas for the vanity of human hopes! Immediately
on falling asleep he dreamed he was once
more standing before his army, saluting them with
mighty leaps and wonderful contortions of body.
He awakened to find himself sprawling on the floor,
with the hide of his predecessor slit from the jointure
of the tail entirely to the neck!</p>

<p>His struggles in dreamland had precipitated the
catastrophe. There was not string enough in the
building to repair this last rent, even had he been
sufficiently skillful to thread it into the partially
decayed hide.</p>

<p>To appear in public on the balcony was no longer
possible, and he was a king only while he could
remain hidden from view. When the least intelligent
of his subjects got a glimpse of him his crown
was lost, never more to be recovered, and Goliah
would reign in his stead—Goliah, from whom he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
might expect the most cruel reprisals for the
temporary loss of power.</p>

<p>Philip was so certain a cruel fate awaited him
that he immediately began to barricade the suite of
apartments as thoroughly as possible under the circumstances,
and before another morning dawned
every movable article of furniture was piled against
the doors in the hope that the final moment might
be delayed a short time.</p>

<p>Then, retreating to the kitchen, he awaited the
inevitable.</p>

<p>From this retired spot he could hear the chattering
and howling of his subjects as they assembled
once more to make inquiries concerning his health,
and he knew beyond a peradventure that not many
hours would elapse before they began to force their
way into the building.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>




<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXIX">CHAPTER XXIX.<br />
<span class="smaller">EXCESSIVE AFFECTION.</span></h2>

<p>Philip’s dismal forebodings were destined to be
realized within a very short time. If his subjects
had been impatient on the day previous because
they only saw him on the balcony, they were
furious now when the windows and doors remained
closed and their king came not forth to greet them.</p>

<p>From his place of refuge he could hear a murmuring
sound, as of the waves on the sea-shore; but
after an hour passed this had increased to a deafening
roar, which was echoed and re-echoed from
every portion of the forest until it seemed as if the
entire island must be covered with apes searching
for their ruler.</p>

<p>Now and then the fugitive could hear a hoarse
cry, which arose above the general din, and in it he
believed he recognized Goliah’s voice. The huge
baboon, who had been only suspicious on the day
previous, was probably positive now that the king
was not all he should be, and was most likely inciting
the multitude to open rebellion.</p>

<p>Judging from the events which followed, it was
not a hard task to induce these long-tailed subjects
to rise in their might, for before noon the attack
was begun.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>The apes, probably understanding that they could
not learn the cause of the king’s indisposition and
sudden disappearance except by demolishing the
building which they themselves had reared, made a
furious attack on all four sides at the same moment.</p>

<p>From previous experience Philip knew that in
this assault they must necessarily be successful
owing to their numbers, and also because it was no
longer possible for him to interpose any lengthy resistance;
therefore he remained in one corner of the
kitchen, with the musket in his hands and the small
amount of ammunition in his pocket, resolved to
sell his life dearly when the supreme moment should
arrive.</p>

<p>Against the sides of the building the heavy missiles
rattled like hail; the walls shook under the repeated
blows, and now and then the crashing and splintering
of roof-timbers told that slowly but surely
Philip’s place of refuge was being reduced to a ruin.</p>

<p>At rare intervals the bombardment ceased as the
entire army burst forth in noisy cries of grief, deafening
howls of sympathy, and groans which were
intended to be expressive of tenderness.</p>

<p>This mourning for their king was always followed
by a more vigorous onslaught, and, as near as Philip
could judge, it was about the hour of sunset when
the building gave way beneath a shower of rocks.
First a heavy crash from above told that the roof
had fallen; then the front wall was forced in, probably
burying amid its ruins the papers and books of
Captain Seaworth, and causing Philip’s hiding-place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
to rock to and fro like a tree shaken by the
wind.</p>

<p>Finally there came that which Philip had not anticipated.</p>

<p>Instead of the dwelling being demolished in such
a manner that he was exposed to view, the walls,
besieged on every side, fell inward; and at the last
deafening crash he commended himself to God, for
it seemed positive he was buried alive.</p>

<p>In the brief space of time which elapsed from the
first shattering of the side-wall until the end came
Philip thought, with intense relief, that he would be
crushed to death rather than murdered by those
who had been so loyal a few days previous. Then
the ceiling and sides of the room burst in, sending
forth great clouds of dust, which from the outside
must have looked like smoke ascending from a
funeral pyre.</p>

<p>The assailants were silenced—awed by their work.
The building was nothing more than a mass of ruin,
but yet no trace of their king could be seen.</p>

<p>Looking from the outside, one would have said
there could be no living thing beneath these enormous
fragments of rock and wood; and yet, strange
as it may seem, Philip was there with not so much
as a single scratch upon his body. It was destined
that his life should not be taken by his subjects during
an assault planned by Goliah.</p>

<p>The heavy furniture, piled up from the door of
the cupboard to the corner of the room as a barricade
in case the apes succeeded in entering the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
building, had been sufficient to uphold the weight
which fell upon it, and the timbers of the ceiling
had formed across the top a perfect support.</p>

<p>The king of the apes, whose reign had been of
such short duration, was thus literally buried alive;
but in this accidental tomb he had provisions sufficient
to serve him many days.</p>

<p>For a few moments after the falling of the timbers
Philip congratulated himself upon this fact;
but his joy was short-lived. He soon realized that
unless—as was improbable—he could have aid from
the outside, the stock of provisions would simply
serve to prolong his wretched life a certain time,
after which death must inevitably come.</p>

<p>“At all events I need not starve,” he said to himself
after some reflection, as he raised his musket;
and with the knowledge that he could invoke death
before the torture of hunger and thirst became
agonizing, he grew more resigned.</p>

<p>Then came a long time of silence, which was
finally broken by the sound as of some one digging
from above.</p>

<p>“Probably the night has passed, during which
the apes were asleep, and now they are searching
for my body,” Philip said to himself; and although
he knew death would be inevitable in case of discovery
(for the mandrill skin had literally been torn
from his body), it was with a certain sense of relief
he learned that the debris from above was being removed.</p>

<p>Yet one does not welcome death, however full of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
torture may be the alternative; and when the noise
made by the army of laborers grew more distinct,
telling that they were approaching nearer to his
narrow prison each moment, the thought of the
struggle which must ensue was very painful. With
twenty cartridges he would hardly be able to hold
the first squad of laborers in check sixty seconds.
Then, unarmed, he must meet those whom he had
so unwittingly deceived.</p>

<p>As the moments passed he was able to form a
definite idea of the approach of his enemies, for in
such a light must he now consider his former subjects.
Already could he see tiny rays of light
through the crevices of the rocks and timbers, and
the shower of dust which fell upon him told that
but a few feet of the debris remained between him
and the open air.</p>

<p>Now he clutched his musket more firmly and
stood on the alert, prepared to spring forward at the
instant the aperture was sufficiently large to admit
of the passage of his body, although he knew that
the ruins were surrounded by an army so great that
it would be impossible to make his way twenty feet
before receiving a death-wound.</p>

<p>It was at this moment, when he had nerved himself
for the struggle he believed was about to ensue,
that he felt, rather than heard, a noise directly
beneath his feet, and even while wondering as to
the cause of it an upheaval of the floor told that the
enemy were searching for him both above and
below.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>Then one of the boards upon which he stood was
pushed aside, almost overturning him, and he
leveled his musket, ready to fire when they should
spring upon him out of what was evidently a tunnel.</p>

<p>The fragments from above had been so far removed
by this time that the darkness was partially
dispersed, allowing him to see everything in the
vicinity quite distinctly.</p>

<p>An ape’s head presented itself from this unexpected
aperture, and, in order to save his ammunition
as far as possible, Philip raised his musket to
strike. Another instant and there would have been
one ape the less on the island—an event well calculated
to plunge the prisoner into an agony of grief.</p>

<p>It was the chimpanzee, Ben Bolt, and not one
of Goliah’s adherents, who had thus come from the
very earth, as it were; and an instant later the besieged
youth was shaking the animal by the paw as
if he were a human being, for there could be no question
but that the two chimpanzees had formed some
plan to extricate their old master from his perilous
position.</p>

<p>There was no time to be wasted in ceremonies,
however. The laborers above had so nearly reached
the tiny place of refuge that fragments of stone
were already falling between the timbers, and the
chimpanzee realized quite as well as did Philip that
to make this means of escape practicable they must
beat an immediate retreat.</p>

<p>The former stood at the edge of the tunnel and
pointed downward with an impatient gesture.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>Philip descended into a narrow excavation barely
large enough to admit of his crawling on his hands
and knees; and here, as if waiting for him, was the
other chimpanzee, who immediately led the way
through the passage, assuring herself that he would
follow by winding her long tail around his neck in
such a manner that he must perforce be dragged if
he could not creep.</p>

<p>Had a spectator been in the place so lately occupied
by Philip he would have seen Ben Bolt pull
the furniture together even above his head, and then,
retreating into the hole, drag some of the floor-boards
after him to hide the existence of the tunnel.</p>

<p>In this he displayed reasoning powers beyond a
peradventure, for those who were working above
would, on reaching the bottom, find no evidences of
an excavation, and it was hardly probable they
would pursue their investigation any further than
the floor of the room.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>




<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXX">CHAPTER XXX.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE RETREAT.</span></h2>

<p>Philip did not attempt to speculate upon the
intelligence displayed by the chimpanzees as he
half-followed and was half-dragged along the narrow
tunnel by Alice.</p>

<p>That these two had recognized in the king of the
apes their old master whose life they had previously
tried to save there could be no question, for on
entering the narrow hiding-place in the house Ben
Bolt had shown no surprise at finding confined there
a man instead of an ape; and on her part, Alice
acted as if recognizing the object of their search.</p>

<p>Both these animals must have been aware of the
deception practiced upon the other apes and received
some inkling of the true state of affairs,
otherwise they would not have been so prompt in
making this excavation for the purpose of rescuing
him.</p>

<p>The labor they had performed was prodigious, as
Philip understood while creeping along the tunnel;
for, although they moved at a reasonably rapid
pace, it was fully twenty minutes before the three
emerged into a thicket of mimosas directly back of
Ben Bolt’s former prison, and to the fugitive it
seemed certain these animals must have commenced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
their labors on the very night when the first mishap
occurred to the skin of royalty.</p>

<p>Perhaps Goliah had made his suspicions public;
or perhaps, again, Ben Bolt or Alice witnessed the
first accident, and understanding who had been
masquerading under the guise of the king, immediately
formed a plan for his liberation. In either
case the result of their labors was certainly brought
about by reason rather than instinct, and the animal-trainer
thought with a certain chagrin of the time
when he believed apes could only be taught by
example emphasized with severe punishment.</p>

<p>On emerging from the tunnel Philip could hear
the shouts and cries of the apes who were searching
the ruins; but the thicket of mimosas hid him from
their view, and after beating down the ground as
well as possible to hide any evidence of the existence
of the tunnel, Ben Bolt motioned for Philip to follow
him.</p>

<p>With Alice bringing up the rear, all three pushed
forward at the utmost speed until they arrived at
the mouth of the grotto in which Philip had
previously taken refuge.</p>

<p>Since Goliah was in command of the apes the two
chimpanzees were exposed to as much danger as
their human comrade, for the huge baboon would
undoubtedly make Ben Bolt a prisoner once more in
order to separate him from his mate; and, therefore,
Philip understood that he was to have the companionship
of these beasts during such time as it
might be necessary to remain in hiding.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>The grotto was far from being a secure place of
retreat, since at any moment a squad of apes might
pass that way, and Philip now took upon himself
the part of conductor, leading the animals directly
into the subterranean chambers which he had discovered.</p>

<p>Here they could have light to a certain degree,
water from the numberless streams, and plenty of
food in the shape of fish; therefore their voluntary
imprisonment might be monotonous but not painful,
however long a time it should continue.</p>

<p>It was probable Goliah’s forces would discover
these under-ground chambers, and to guard as far
as possible against what might prove a dire calamity,
Philip set about filling the passage leading from
the grotto with fragments of limestone, taken from
the chamber of statutes.</p>

<p>In this work he was aided by the chimpanzees
very materially, and before three hours had passed
they were in what appeared to be an impregnable
position.</p>

<p>So far as Philip had discovered there was no
means of entrance to the subterranean chamber save
through the grotto, and with the tunnel half-filled
by rocks, there was every reason to believe a siege
could be sustained indefinitely. The animals appeared
to understand quite as well as did their
human companion that they were comparatively
safe from Goliah and his forces, and hand in hand
they wandered through the caverns, uttering exclamations
of surprise or chattering with each other in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
a low tone, but returning to Philip every moment to
make sure he would not again disappear from their
view.</p>

<p>A dinner and supper of boiled fish, then a long
time of unbroken repose, and another day dawned.</p>

<p>During the hours devoted to slumber Philip had
resolved that, in order to occupy his mind and provide
the needful exercise for all, he would again
take up his work of gathering gold, although it
might not be possible to carry it away. When
breakfast had been cooked in the boiling spring,
and eaten, he motioned for the chimpanzees to follow
him down the course of the stream.</p>

<p>In order to make them understand what he wished
to do, it was only necessary to take from the water a
few of the yellow nuggets, compare them with bits
of limestone to show the difference in color, and
then carry them to the hiding-place behind the
statue. One example was sufficient, and without
delay the animals set about gathering the treasure,
so useless while Philip remained on the island, but
of such great value if he could succeed in conveying
it to any civilized portion of the world.</p>

<p>It was not his intention to make of this treasure-gathering
absolute labor, but only to perform so
much of it as would give the needed exercise in confinement;
and after the chimpanzees had worked
industriously three hours he motioned for them to
desist.</p>

<p>Stretched out on the cool white sand in the cavern
nearest the grotto, all three of the fugitives enjoyed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
a most pleasant siesta. They could contrast
the heat outside with the refreshing coolness of the
under-ground residence, and Philip admitted to himself
that to remain shut up here several weeks might
not be as unpleasant as would seem at first thought.</p>

<p>Thus alternately working and resting, the time
passed at a reasonably rapid rate until Philip judged
that one week of this voluntary imprisonment had
elapsed.</p>

<p>During all this time nothing had been heard from
the apes, and the chimpanzees no longer acted as
if fearing each moment their enemies would find
them out. Even Philip felt reassured on this point,
and was beginning to make preparations for sending
Ben Bolt on a reconnoitering expedition, or of going
himself, when loud shouts from the outside proclaimed
the fact that Goliah’s army had at last discovered
their hiding-place.</p>

<p>Even now Philip felt but little alarm, for by barricading
the tunnel it would be possible to hold the
entire force at bay.</p>

<p>Goliah, however, did not propose to let his army
expend their energy and time in shrieking. About
noon on the eighth day of Philip’s voluntary imprisonment
the sounds from the grotto proclaimed
the fact that the enemy were making preparations
for entering the passage.</p>

<p>At the first alarm the chimpanzees were nearly
beside themselves with fright; but after observing
Philip’s calm demeanor they appeared to gain confidence,
and in less than an hour both were sufficiently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
composed to render such aid as their human
companion required.</p>

<p>The work of maintaining a defense was not
arduous. It consisted simply in breaking the naturally-formed
statues into fragments—which was
easily done owing to the porous nature of the stone—and
packing the pieces into the passage as fast as
the wall gave evidence of being weakened by the
besiegers.</p>

<p>“They may go on with that sort of work for a
month without being able to get at us,” Philip said,
much as if the chimpanzees needed encouragement
and could understand what he said. “We have
only to keep on hand a plentiful supply of material,
and the advantage will all be on our side.”</p>

<p>Before the day came to an end the animals had
learned so well what was necessary that their companion
had no hesitation about trusting them to
continue the defense while he caught and prepared
fish for supper.</p>

<p>During the night the enemy remained silent, but
at the first break of day the attack was continued—this
time so methodically that the forenoon was but
half spent when the barricade was so far destroyed
that Philip could see the besiegers at the further
end of the tunnel.</p>

<p>They labored in couples, dragging out the rocks
and passing them to those in the rear, who formed
a long chain to the outer end of the grotto, where
the fragments were thrown down the incline at such
a point that the movement of the army would not
be impeded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>

<p>In this order of working it was possible for them
to gain very materially upon the defenders of the
cavern, and for the first time since having taken
refuge in this place Philip began to fear they
might eventually be dragged from what he had believed
was a secure retreat, unless it should be possible
to change their own plan.</p>

<p>It was while he stood at the mouth of the tunnel
trying to devise some means of accelerating the
work of defense that he was startled by hearing
the report of a cannon in the distance.</p>

<p>His companions immediately rushed to his side, as
if understanding that this booming noise meant deliverance
for him whom they had labored so hard;
and while the three were listening intently a second
report was heard.</p>

<p>Now the besiegers began to understand that
something unusual was occurring on the island, and
when the third report rang out on the still air
Philip shouted, in a loud voice:</p>

<p>“A vessel has come! Captain Seaworth has returned,
and we shall be able to leave this terrible
place!”</p>

<p>The besiegers, confounded and uneasy because
of the detonations, which were several times repeated
by the echoes, came to a decided stand-still,
while Goliah, who was stationed just inside the
grotto, leaned forward, sniffing the air and showing
every symptom of uneasiness.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXXI">CHAPTER XXXI.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE RETURN OF THE COLONISTS.</span></h2>

<p>With stones in their hands, muzzles turned in
the direction of the wind, outstretched necks,
hair standing on end, and ears pricked up, the apes
tried to realize what Philip himself would have been
only too well pleased to understand.</p>

<p>There could be no question but that a vessel was
near, yet there were many chances that Philip’s first
explanation of the reason of the cannonading was
not the true one.</p>

<p>In the cavern it was impossible to say that a tempest
might not be raging, and the ship, having
struck a reef, was signaling for assistance. Or,
again, the Malay pirates were perhaps attacking
some vessels close under the lee of the land. In
fact, there were very many ways of explaining the
reasons for this discharge of ordnance without attributing
it to the return of the colonists, and
Philip’s first flush of joy was immediately turned to
anxiety.</p>

<p>Half an hour passed, during which the besiegers
remained like statues, gazing toward the sea; and
then, to Philip’s intense relief and almost overwhelming
happiness, came the sound of human
voices.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>The apes appeared to be more and more astonished.
The greater number looked frightened, and
were already seeking with furtive glances favorable
openings for immediate flight. Goliah alone remained
firm; but it was possible to tell from the expression
of his face that he shared very sensibly in
the alarm of his subjects.</p>

<p>Five minutes more passed, and Philip fancied he
could hear the tramp of many feet in the distance,
when Goliah gave vent to a shrill, piercing whistle,
and in an instant every one of the besiegers disappeared.
Not a single ape remained in front of the
grotto, and only for a few seconds could Philip see
their vanishing tails as they sought refuge in the
thicket.</p>

<p>Now, instead of trying to fill up the tunnel, those
in the subterranean chamber began tearing away at
the rocks with feverish energy; and five minutes
later Philip, followed by the two chimpanzees,
emerged from the grotto into one of the broad roads
built under his supervision as king, down which
could be seen a large body of men, in the immediate
vicinity of the village.</p>

<p>To run forward at the swiftest possible pace was
the most natural thing for Philip to do, and in a few
moments he was standing before Captain Seaworth,
muttering incoherent words expressive of his deep
joy, while the two chimpanzees followed close behind
him, looking as if they also were relieved in
mind by the coming of human beings.</p>

<p>The appearance of Philip, covered as he was with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
the fragments of an ape’s skin, caused the most profound
astonishment among those who had just
landed.</p>

<p>They looked upon him as if believing that he was
a veritable wild man, and not a few gave way at his
approach, fearing he might inflict some injury upon
them.</p>

<p>Although Captain Seaworth and several of his
officers were well acquainted with Philip Garland,
the animal-trainer, they failed to recognize in this
forlorn-looking specimen of humanity the once prosperous
merchant, and after gazing at him several
moments in undisguised astonishment the captain
asked, sternly:</p>

<p>“Who are you?”</p>

<p>“A shipwrecked youth, whose life has been in
danger during the past three months.”</p>

<p>“One would say you were more ape than human,”
the captain replied with a smile.</p>

<p>“And so I have been; but now the time has come
when I can assume my proper place among human
beings. This hide is not mine.”</p>

<p>“Which is lucky for you,” one of the officers
added, and several laughed heartily, “otherwise we
might think it a deed of charity to finish skinning
you.”</p>

<p>Then Captain Seaworth, looking at the chimpanzees
as if he recognized them, asked:</p>

<p>“How comes it that you have adopted two of my
former pets as your servants?”</p>

<p>“These are animals which I once owned and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
trained, and afterward sold to you, captain,” Philip
said laughingly; and the gentleman, looking up
quickly, repeated:</p>

<p>“You sold them to me?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I am, or at least I was, Philip Garland,
dealer in wild animals, and sold you these chimpanzees,
together with a baboon which I wish had been
killed years ago.”</p>

<p>It is needless to describe the astonishment caused
by these words. In this youth, only partially covered
with the tattered skin of an ape, and with matted and
disheveled hair, the officers of the Reynard began
to distinguish some familiar features, and a moment
later Philip was overwhelmed with questions.</p>

<p>To tell his story would require no slight amount
of time, and he proposed that it be delayed until a
more fitting moment, for he, in turn, was eager to
learn the reasons of the colonists’ sudden departure;
therefore he said:</p>

<p>“Inasmuch as your leaving the island has caused
me no slight amount of uneasiness and mystification,
and can be told more quickly than my story,
suppose you first explain. This evening you shall
learn the particulars of my reign, for during at least
half of my stay here I have been king of the apes.”</p>

<p>“It will require but a few words to clear up what
has seemed a mystery if, as I presume, you have already
seen the log-book.”</p>

<p>“I have, and the last page in it contained an
account of the pirates’ warning which was found on
the beach.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<p>“Exactly,” the captain replied. “In regard to
that, Mr. Clark evidently overlooked the weapon on
the previous day, for before nightfall we saw the
Malay fleet in the offing. It was composed of so
many proas that to give battle would have been the
height of foolishness, and in the least possible time
we embarked on the Reynard, slipping her cables
and standing out to sea. It was better to lose our
property than run the risk of losing our lives.</p>

<p>“The people were making preparations for a ball,
and no work was being done on the plantation,
therefore it was possible to embark in less than an
hour from the time of the first alarm; but to save
any of the household goods was out of the question.
The papers relating to the settlement of the island
I intended to take with me; but in the hurried
departure they, like a great many other things,
were forgotten until it was so late that to return
for them would have been the height of imprudence,
and we abandoned everything with the faint hope
of recovering the property on our return.</p>

<p>“A running fight could be made provided we succeeded
in preventing the pirates from boarding us;
and with a ten-knot breeze we dashed through the
fleet without receiving any injury. They opened
fire as a matter of course; but those scoundrels do
not count upon a fight at long range, because their
weapons are not calculated to do much execution
from a distance.</p>

<p>“We were not idle. Every gun of the six we had
on board was trained with good effect, and before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
they could crawl out of range we sank three proas.
Two more of the crafts were disabled, and one was
so splintered about the hull that before we were out
of sight her crew took to the boats. It was a lesson
which I fancy they will not forget for some time;
and now that we are to have such an increase of
numbers, it will be a very long while before the
pirates, either from Sooloo or Magindinao, dare to
pay us a visit.</p>

<p>“We made Batavia in due course of time, took on
more colonists, and arranged for a large number to
follow. They will be here in a few days, and I have
returned to complete our work; but I fancy quite as
much has been destroyed by the apes as would have
been had the pirates landed, although I am surprised
at seeing these magnificent thoroughfares, which
must have cost no small amount of time and labor.”</p>

<p>“As king of the apes I have been able to do the
colony some good,” Philip replied. “These roads
were laid out by my subjects, and as far as possible
I have endeavored to repair the buildings which
they destroyed during the first battle; but of this I
shall tell you later.”</p>

<p>Then Captain Seaworth and his officers, eager to
hear Philip’s story, proposed that all go on board
the Reynard, where the unfortunate man could procure
suitable garments; and while the colonists were
engaged in ascertaining the amount of damage done
the dwellings the little party went to the coast, the
chimpanzees following Philip very closely, as if only
in his presence could they hope for protection from
the vengeful Goliah.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p>The remainder of that day was spent as far as
Captain Seaworth and his officers were concerned,
in listening to Philip’s adventures, and when night
came one can well fancy the happy sense of relief
and security which the animal-trainer experienced
on being able to lie down once more in a bed with
no fear of an attack from the apes.</p>

<p>It was decided that the chimpanzees should be
allowed to go whithersoever they pleased; but after
the first visit to the ship no amount of persuasion
could induce them to go on shore again. They appeared
to realize that only there were they safe,
and having been given quarters in a shanty which
the carpenter built on deck, they were apparently
the most contented of all the ship’s company.</p>

<p>Not until the following day, while the workmen
were engaged in restoring the buildings and otherwise
putting the settlement into the same shape as
it had been at the time of their departure, did
Philip tell Captain Seaworth of the discovery he had
made in the subterranean chamber. Had he related
this portion of his adventures in public the work of
establishing the plantation would have been speedily
abandoned, for once the fever for gold attacks man
all industries languish, and the idea of gaining
wealth from the bed of the under-ground stream
would have been more disastrous to the colony than
many visits from the pirates.</p>

<p>Even Captain Seaworth was undecided as to what
should be done. He fully realized the danger
attending his enterprise should this discovery be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
made known, and after much thought he said to
Philip:</p>

<p>“We will let this remain a secret between you
and me for the present. You can at different times
convey the gold which has been gathered to my
house, or to the ship, without letting any of the
colonists know what you are doing. Only in the
event of our failing to make of this island a fruitful
plantation will we acquaint even my most trusty
officers with this new source of wealth.”</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXXII">CHAPTER XXXII.<br />
<span class="smaller">A BOATSWAIN’S FATE.</span></h2>

<p>As a matter of course, Philip was enabled
to resume his proper habiliments as soon as he
stepped on board the Reynard, Captain Seaworth
supplying him with a full outfit, and it was with no
slight degree of satisfaction that he surveyed himself
in the mirror.</p>

<p>His long and peculiar residence on the island rendered
him a valuable adviser to Captain Seaworth,
and it was decided that during such time as he
would be obliged to remain, owing to the limited
means of transportation, he was to act as a member
of the board of directors.</p>

<p>The first labor the colonists engaged in was the
repairing of the houses which had been injured during
the last siege. Then every dwelling was fortified,
as far as possible, for it was not to be supposed
that such a large body of apes, having once had
possession of the settlement, would remain very
long at a respectful distance.</p>

<p>Philip’s advice to Captain Seaworth was that before
anything was done toward restoring the plantations
to their former condition some means be devised
for ridding the island of the mischievous and
vindictive animals. To plant anew would be only to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
provide something for the apes to destroy, and it
was by no means safe for the male colonists to go
into the fields, leaving the cottages unprotected,
since Goliah might lead his forces to an attack at
any moment; therefore if the scheme of transforming
the island into a garden was to be carried out,
the first and all-important task was the destruction
or subjugation of the apes.</p>

<p>No one knew better than Philip how difficult
would be such a task. At the very lowest computation
there were two thousand of these long-tailed
brutes against whom war must be waged, and, as
has already been shown, they were no mean antagonists.
One such as Goliah would be more than a
match for three unarmed men, and the strictest orders
were issued that the colonists should only go
from one point to another when in large numbers,
and with sufficient weapons to repel any onslaught
which might be made.</p>

<p>This order was promulgated on the afternoon of
the same day the Reynard entered the little cove,
and before twelve hours had elapsed those of the
colonists who thought such a precaution foolish
were fully convinced of its wisdom.</p>

<p>The boatswain of the ship, whose constant boast
it was that he could overcome, single-handed, any
three men who might be opposed to him, laughed
at the idea of banding together to resist an attack
by monkeys, and openly declared that he was not
afraid of all the apes in the Malay Archipelago.
He even went so far as to intimate that Philip was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
little less than a chicken-hearted fellow to allow
himself to be made a prisoner by such animals, and
to do their bidding like a slave. In fact, he did not
hesitate to say he doubted Mr. Garland’s story very
seriously, and otherwise made so much sport of the
“Munchausen Tales,” as he called them, that many
of the colonists were disposed to share in his incredulity.</p>

<p>At about four o’clock in the afternoon Captain
Seaworth decided to have one of the small cannon
brought from the Reynard for the better defense of
the village, and instructed the boatswain to proceed
to the ship with a sufficient number of men for
mutual protection.</p>

<p>“I am going alone,” the old sailor said when he
emerged from the captain’s temporary dwelling,
speaking to a number of his comrades with whom
he had previously been discussing the alleged facts
of Philip’s story. “I’ll make it my business to walk
half-around the island just to show how much truth
there is in the yarn of this monkey-trainer, who
has been scared out of his senses by two or three
tame baboons.”</p>

<p>Of course this would be a total disregard of the
captain’s express commands; but the boatswain flattered
himself that his disobedience would not be
known save to those in whose eyes he wished to appear
as a hero, and away he started, armed only
with a stout cudgel, which he declared was enough
to frighten all the apes on the island into convulsions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>

<p>Three hours later, the piece of ordnance not having
arrived, Captain Seaworth sent half a dozen colonists
to the ship, and in due time they returned
with the information that the boatswain had not
arrived at the coast. The foolhardy man had been
absent from the settlement sufficiently long to have
made four or five trips to the tiny harbor, and, believing
his desire to show contempt for the apes had
resulted in a catastrophe, those who heard his boasts
laid the matter before the captain and Philip.</p>

<p>It was then too late to make any search for the
unfortunate man, since night, which comes on so
suddenly in the tropics, was already close at hand,
and it would be worse than reckless to venture into
the thicket where the animals could so readily conceal
themselves.</p>

<p>That Goliah and his forces had taken the boatswain
prisoner, even if they had not murdered him,
Philip felt certain; but nothing could be done until
morning, and immediately after sunrise fifty well-armed
men set out, following as nearly as possible
the supposed direction in which he had gone.</p>

<p>The search was not of long duration. When the
party arrived within a hundred yards of the terminus
of the road leading to the south they saw
that which caused the stoutest-hearted to draw back
with a shudder.</p>

<p>Hanging to the lower limb of a mangrove-tree,
exactly as Philip had seen the skeleton of the mandrill
suspended, was the unfortunate boatswain. The
rope for the execution of the deed had been formed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
from strips of his clothing, and a party of Western
lynchers could not have done the deed more thoroughly.</p>

<p>From such slight evidence as could be seen among
the underbrush or foliage, it was not probable the
sailor had had an opportunity to defend himself
more than a few seconds. Most likely Goliah’s forces
leaped upon him so quickly, and in such numbers,
that before he could strike many blows he was over-powered;
but that he was alive when suspended
from the tree could be readily seen.</p>

<p>After the unfortunate man was given a Christian
burial there was not one among the colonists who
questioned any detail of Philip’s story, however improbable
it may have seemed. Now that there
could be no question as to the dangers which menaced,
Captain Seaworth resolved to rid the island of
the brutes, if possible; and to this end, acting under
Philip’s advice, he went to work systematically.</p>

<p>The buildings were left in charge of forty well-armed
men, and the strictest orders issued against
the women venturing out of doors under any pretense.
Then all save a force necessary to guard
the ship were set at work cutting paths through the
thicket at different angles from the settlement, in
order that there should be no opportunity of concealment
for the apes within reach of the house.</p>

<p>This task required no small amount of labor, and
three days elapsed before the colonists were in
condition to open the battle.</p>

<p>During this time they had every evidence that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
Goliah’s forces were watching them intently, for
more than once could be heard shrill cries in the
thicket as if spies were reporting to their commander
the progress made, and on several occasions
the workmen saw dark forms flitting by, but at
such a pace as to render it impossible to shoot with
any accuracy of aim.</p>

<p>It was on the night previous to the day set for the
general attack that the vessel from Batavia arrived
with reinforcements, and then Captain Seaworth
had quite an army under his command.</p>

<p>Had the colonists been going forth to meet a
regularly organized force of men they could not
have proceeded more carefully. The new-comers,
who were well aware of the fighting qualities of
apes, were by no means disposed to make light of
the intended engagement, but at the same time no
one seemed disposed to shirk his duty.</p>

<p>Divided into squads of twenty, each man carrying
fifty rounds of ammunition, the detachments started
from the village, marching through the paths and
down the roads, and diverging as do the spokes of a
wheel from its hub.</p>

<p>Philip, who commanded the party which proceeded
toward the south, had tried to induce the
chimpanzees to accompany him, believing they could
give timely warning of the approach of the enemy;
but these intelligent animals were far too wise to
put their precious bodies in such jeopardy. They
probably understood what the result would be in
case of capture, and all the inducements held out by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
their master were insufficient to persuade them even
to step over the ship’s rail.</p>

<p>During the first half hour after the forces began
to advance, those in the village heard no sound.
Then came a few scattering shots, followed by
another time of silence, until finally the rattle of
regular and rapid firing from the road down which
Philip had passed told the anxious listeners that the
battle was in progress.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>




<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXXIII">CHAPTER XXXIII.<br />
<span class="smaller">A PITCHED BATTLE.</span></h2>

<p>The party commanded by Philip had
marched down the broad avenue fully two-thirds
of the entire distance from the village to the
sea-shore without seeing so much as the tip of an
ape’s tail, when suddenly every man came to a halt
without waiting for the word of command as a
piercing scream from the thicket at the left rang out
on the clear air.</p>

<p>Involuntarily the colonists gazed in the direction
from whence the cry had come, and as they did so a
vast army of apes poured out from the thicket on
the opposite side of the road armed with stones and
sticks, attacking them with such fury that before
the men could recover from their bewilderment
three had fallen mortally wounded.</p>

<p>Philip, who was in the rear of the troops, delayed
firing in the hope of having as a target the gigantic
form of Goliah.</p>

<p>In this, however, he was unsuccessful, for that
worthy had taken good care to be out of harm’s
way, although more than once Philip fancied he saw
his grinning face. It was but a few seconds, however,
that he could remain inactive, so vigorous and
well-directed was the shower of rocks, and then he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
discharged his repeating-rifle again and again into
the solid ranks of apes without producing any
apparent effect.</p>

<p>During fifteen minutes this hot engagement continued,
and then, as a shrill cry arose which could be
distinctly heard above the rattle of musketry, every
ape who was left alive vanished amid the thicket in
a twinkling, leaving the colonists at liberty to count
the cost of this first attempt at subduing the original
proprietors of the soil.</p>

<p>Five men were dead, three severely wounded, and
hardly one had escaped without some injury. On
the other side at least forty apes were left behind,
either dead or unable to beat a retreat. It was safe
to assume that as many more had carried away
bullets in their bodies; but this made the victory a
costly one for the colonists, when the number of
apes supposed to be on the island was taken into
consideration.</p>

<p>“Twenty engagements like this and we shall no
longer have men enough to defend the village,”
Philip said to himself as he gave the order for the
dead and dying to be carried back to the dwellings.</p>

<p>While this portion of Captain Seaworth’s army
were returning in funeral procession the sounds of
conflict could be heard from the extreme northern
end of the road, and the reports of the weapons continued
for about ten minutes, when they died away
entirely, causing Philip to believe the apes had pursued
the same tactics as during the first engagement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p>

<p>When Philip and his decimated party reached the
main building of the settlement, the squad of men
commanded by Mr. Clark, first officer of the Reynard,
could be seen approaching, bearing ominous-looking
burdens, which told that their portion of the
conflict had also been attended with fatal results.
As the remainder of the colonists returned, company
by company, having seen no signs of the enemy,
Captain Seaworth called a council of war, since it
was evident that Goliah did not intend to give battle
again during this day.</p>

<p>As nearly as could be judged about a hundred of
the apes had been killed, or so severely wounded as
to make their deaths certain; but, on the other hand,
twelve men were dead, and fully twenty so badly
disabled as to render it impossible for them to take
any further part in the defense of the settlement
for many weeks to come.</p>

<p>“To continue in this way will simply be to exterminate
ourselves,” Captain Seaworth said when
his officers were assembled. “The apes so far outnumber
us that in less than a week we shall be at
the mercy of the animals unless some safer plan of
attack can be devised; therefore I call upon you,
gentlemen, for an expression of opinion as to what
course we shall pursue.”</p>

<p>Among the entire party there was no one who
could make a suggestion which seemed at all feasible.
Even Philip was at a loss to know what
course could be pursued with any chance of ultimate
success, and but for the fact that he was afraid of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
being called a coward he would then and there have
advised an abandonment of the scheme of colonizing
the island.</p>

<p>It was not until the unsatisfactory session had
nearly ended that Mr. Clark proposed a plan whereby
it might be possible to inflict injury upon the
apes without suffering any loss of life themselves.</p>

<p>“Let us bring all the heavy cannon from the
ship,” he said, “and place them in the dwellings
where the openings in the forest can be commanded.
Then for two or three days every person on the
island shall remain concealed. By the end of that
time the apes may fancy we have beat a retreat and
gather around the buildings in such force that we
can kill off a few hundred. It is not a very brilliant
suggestion, I must admit; but since no one has anything
better to offer, it will be only a waste of
seventy-two hours at the most to try the experiment.”</p>

<p>No member of the party cared to say that he was
really afraid of an army of apes, although many
had greater or less doubt as to whether they would
ever be able to carry out the original scheme of
making there a plantation, and the first officer’s
plan met with the approbation of all.</p>

<p>“Two parties, numbering fifty each, will proceed
at once to the ship for the purpose of bringing on
shore the heavy guns,” the captain said, as he adjourned
the council, “and after they have been
placed in position all the women and a portion of
the natives must take refuge on the Reynard, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
the remainder of our force conceal themselves in
the houses.”</p>

<p>With this the party separated. Mr. Clark and
Philip were detailed to command the respective
crews who were to bring up the ordnance, and the
others, with Captain Seaworth at their head, went
to pay the last honors to those who had fallen in
the singular engagement.</p>

<p>The ship’s surgeon was the busiest man on the
island, and while the dead were being suitably interred
he, with the women as nurses, established a
hospital in the court-yard of Captain Seaworth’s
house. The awnings were replaced by spare canvas;
hammocks were slung on either side, where
patients would be most likely to get the benefit of
cooling draughts of air, and every preparation was
made for a long time of enforced seclusion.</p>

<p>The four central buildings of the village were
selected as the ones to be fortified; holes were
pierced in the shutters to receive the muzzles of the
cannon, and loop-holes made that the men might be
able to train the pieces. Powder, grape and canister
were brought in large quantities from the ship
and stacked up in the rooms, until the buildings intended
for the peaceful occupancy of industrious
colonists looked like the embrasures of a fort.</p>

<p>At the end of the day succeeding the battle everything
was in readiness for the experiment, and fully
two-thirds of the colonists were sent on board the
Reynard, with orders to remain concealed. It was
not deemed advisable to remove the wounded from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
the court-yard, for unless the apes should begin a
regular siege, as they had done when Philip was
alone, this temporary hospital would not be exposed
to an attack.</p>

<p>Captain Seaworth, Philip, Mr. Clark and the second
mate had charge of the cannon, and from sunrise
on the first day after these arrangements had
been completed the four commanders watched carefully
and eagerly for the coming of the apes, whose
curiosity it was hoped would lead them to their
death.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p>




<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXXIV">CHAPTER XXXIV.<br />
<span class="smaller">APISH STRATEGY.</span></h2>

<p>From the moment when everything was in
readiness for the carrying out of Mr. Clark’s
scheme there were no sounds to be heard on the
island save those caused by the apes or the myriad
forms of insect life. It was as if the colonists had
suddenly been stricken dumb; and so careful was
the captain and his officers to carry out the plan
thoroughly that this silence was not broken by any
one under their command.</p>

<p>Save for the six ominous-looking protuberances
from the shutters, everything about the village was
as it had been when the colonists fled before the
pirates, and even human beings might have been deceived
by this pretended abandonment of the island.</p>

<p>It was not expected that the apes would make
any demonstration during the hours of darkness;
therefore, with the exception of a sentinel at each
loop-hole, the entire party slept until morning, when
certain noises in the adjacent forest proclaimed the
fact that Goliah’s forces had taken note of the unusual
silence.</p>

<p>It so chanced that Philip was stationed at a point
overlooking the same portion of the thicket as when
he alone defended the building; and inasmuch as it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
was directly opposite his station that Goliah had
taken his stand during both times the settlement
had been attacked, the animal-trainer naturally
hoped the huge baboon would direct the movements
of his followers from the spot he had previously occupied.</p>

<p>If the leader could be killed it was but natural to
suppose his followers would be dispersed, and
Philip’s great desire was to put an end to the career
of the baboon who had caused him so much suffering.</p>

<p>Two hours after sunrise the first decisive move
was made by the enemy. Previous to this moment
they could have been heard chattering among the
thickets; but now a party of about a dozen, who had
evidently been sent forward to spy out the situation
of affairs, came boldly from the shelter of the trees
and marched entirely around the settlement.</p>

<p>The purpose of the concealed party was to wait
until the main body of the enemy had been massed
where a volley of grape-shot could be sent into their
midst; therefore these spies were allowed to return
to their leaders unmolested.</p>

<p>At the end of the third hour another party reconnoitered
in much the same fashion as had the first,
save that they went on the verandas of several cottages,
trying the doors and windows, and when they
disappeared to make a report Philip understood that
the time was near at hand when a salutary lesson
might be given.</p>

<p>From the thicket could be heard a noise as of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
breaking limbs, shrill cries of command, and now
and then a hoarse shout from Goliah, until suddenly
fully one-half the main body of apes burst
into view from among the foliage.</p>

<p>Philip looked in vain for Goliah; that wily old
baboon had no intention of exposing his precious
person when there were soldiers enough under his
command to do the fighting.</p>

<p>The guns were already trained, and at the signal,
which was the discharge of a revolver by one of
the men stationed near Captain Seaworth, the six
cannon belched forth their iron hail, mowing great
gaps through the enemy’s lines.</p>

<p>There was no opportunity to repeat this dose, for
in a twinkling every animal who yet had command
of his limbs disappeared, and nothing was left in
view of the concealed party save huge piles of dead
and wounded.</p>

<p>Although it was not probable the apes would
show themselves again, no sound was made by those
in concealment save such as was necessary in reloading
the cannon, and until four o’clock that afternoon
all remained on the alert, but without seeing or
hearing a single member of Goliah’s forces.</p>

<p>That it was useless to continue the ambush any
longer Captain Seaworth knew perfectly well, and
at the word of command the colonists came out
from their hiding-places to perform such duties as
were absolutely necessary in the way of preparing
food for themselves and their wounded comrades in
the court-yard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span></p>

<p>Among the first work to be done was to bury the
slain, for in that tropical climate the bodies would
decompose rapidly, and thus, even after death, be a
source of danger to those who had killed them.</p>

<p>The number of the fallen was less than had at first
been supposed. One hundred and twelve were all
that could be found, and while it was reasonable to
believe fully as many more had received wounds of
which they would soon die, the ranks of the enemy
had not been decimated to any appreciable extent.</p>

<p>The sun set before the deep trench which had been
dug to receive the bodies was filled, and after this
duty had been performed preparations were made
for the night, since it was possible Goliah might try
to avenge the blow which had been struck.</p>

<p>As the shadows lengthened and the deep gloom
settled down over the island gunners were stationed
at the pieces once more, and again the little village
was in a state of comparative repose, save directly
in the rear, where half a dozen men were bringing
water and hewing wood.</p>

<p>Captain Seaworth had the same idea as had Philip,
that, true to their imitative habits, the apes, if
they made an attack after nightfall, would do so at
the same point from which their previous efforts
had been directed, and, therefore, but little attention
was given to what might be passing in the
rear.</p>

<p>The cooks were preparing a hearty meal, for the
men in ambush had not been served with anything
warm during two days. The kitchen doors and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
windows were open, and the laborers were pursuing
their respective tasks without thought of harm,
when suddenly a volley of rocks, coming thickly as
drops of rain in a summer shower, descended upon
the unprotected portion of the main building, taking
by most complete surprise even those who were on
the alert.</p>

<p>As these missiles struck the sides and roof of the
house or fell through the open doors and windows,
the noise was so deafening that fully five minutes
elapsed before Captain Seaworth could make his orders
understood, and in that brief time no slight
amount of damage had been done.</p>

<p>The awning in the court-yard was partially torn
down; several of the wounded men received still
further injury; two of the cooks were disabled, and
the stove was overturned, strewing the coals on the
kitchen floor in such a way as started a blaze among
the dry wood, which threatened speedy destruction
to the house.</p>

<p>There was no longer any thought of retaliation,
for it was necessary that the flames should be extinguished
before they gained too much headway,
and the orders were to form lines for passing water.</p>

<p>Hardly had this work been begun when another
shower of rocks descended upon the laborers, driving
them in from the spring as several of the party fell
under the well-directed assault, and during the short
time of confusion which ensued the fire gained no
inconsiderable headway.</p>

<p>Only three or four men could work to advantage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
at bringing water from the spring in the court-yard,
for the flow was not large enough to permit of
much being carried at a time, and while they were
engaged in this nearly useless labor Captain Seaworth
ordered all the others save those in charge
of the cannon to form a cordon around the building
for the purpose of keeping up an incessant discharge
of musketry into the thicket.</p>

<p>Not a single ape could be seen as the men marched
bravely to their posts amid the falling missiles, and
their volleys, however rapid, had but little effect,
owing to the fact that they were forced to fire at
random.</p>

<p>After the muskets had been emptied half a dozen
times, and the attack had been checked in some
slight degree, every third man was told off to fight
the flames; but so much time had elapsed that before
the work was well begun it could be plainly
seen that all their efforts were vain.</p>

<p>Then, in order to save the lives of the helpless
ones in the court-yard, a still larger number of defenders
were assigned the duty of conveying the
wounded to a building on the outskirts of the settlement,
and while this was being done it seemed as if
every tree in the vicinity concealed an enemy who
kept up a continuous discharge of rocks.</p>

<p>For those in charge of the cannon to remain in
the house where they could only shoot directly in
front was useless, and under Philip’s command the
ordnance was taken outside. From this point, first
in one direction and then another, heavy charges of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
small shot were poured into the thicket from whence
came the missiles in the greatest profusion, but evidently
without doing much injury to the enemy.</p>

<p>The situation was now deplorable. That the
main portion of the settlement would be consumed
there could be no question, for the flames had
fastened upon the wings on either side of the court-yard,
and as all the cottages were of such an inflammable
material it needed but little to complete the
work of destruction.</p>

<p>The glare of the flames threw into brightest
relief those who were struggling to protect themselves
and save the property, and thus they afforded

<span class="smaller">THE RETREAT.</span></h2>

<p>By the time the wounded had been removed
from the building at least half a dozen more
men were in need of the surgeon’s skill, for since the
flames had illuminated the scene so brilliantly the
apes were able to aim with more accuracy, and
Captain Seaworth soon began to realize that his
entire force might be killed or disabled if any
further attempt at fighting fire was made.</p>

<p>Philip was so deeply engaged in directing the
movements of those at the cannon that he paid no
attention to what was taking place outside his own
sphere of action. Knowing perfectly well the manners
of the apes, he understood that if the volleys of
grape should cease even for a few moments Goliah’s
forces would charge in overwhelming numbers, believing
the colonists were growing weaker. Therefore,
as rapidly as four men could clean and load
each piece, it was discharged point-blank at that portion
of the thicket in which the enemy appeared to
be concealed in greatest force.</p>

<p>The range was too short to permit of the grape-shot
doing as much execution as it would have done
at five or six times the distance, and after seven or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
eight rounds had been fired Philip discarded the
iron balls entirely, loading the cannon heavily with
pebbles and fragments of rock, which, flying in
every direction, would spread over a much larger
space than round shot.</p>

<p>It was while he was most active in this work, and
when the two cottages immediately adjoining the
central dwelling had caught fire, that Captain Seaworth
approached the chief of artillery looking
troubled and pale.</p>

<p>“That a body of men should be routed by apes
seems ridiculous,” he said; “but at this moment I
confess I see no chance of success in this unequal
battle. What is your opinion?”</p>

<p>Philip delayed answering only long enough to discharge
one cannon at the thicket of mimosas south
of the burning village, and then, after directing the
gunners to clean and reload the piece in the shortest
possible time, he replied, gravely:</p>

<p>“I am ready to obey your orders, captain, whatever
they may be, and however much they vary
from my own ideas; but I am convinced that a continuation
of this fight will result in the disablement
of all your forces. Already the natives are growing
alarmed in the presence of an unseen enemy
who, without fire-arms, can do so much execution,
and if they should become panic-stricken the white
members of the party will be left to the mercy of
the apes.”</p>

<p>“Then you propose——”</p>

<p>“I propose nothing, captain. I have simply given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
my opinion because you asked it, and not with any
desire to influence your movement.”</p>

<p>Then Philip rushed forward to another cannon
which had been loaded, and after discharging it returned
to Captain Seaworth, who said:</p>

<p>“I am convinced you are correct. With the
limited amount of water at our command it will be
impossible to stay the progress of the flames, and we
must leave the village to its destruction. Withdraw
your guns one by one after I have sent the wounded
to the ship. It will be necessary for you to cover
the retreat with the cannon, because we have so
many in the hospital that nearly the entire working-force
are required to transport them.”</p>

<p>“Then it is to be a retreat?”</p>

<p>“If we were fighting against men I should feel
warranted in a complete surrender to prevent
further slaughter; but since that is impossible it
must be as you say—a retreat. I will send those
who are fighting the flames to assist you in the
more rapid discharge of the cannon while we are
carrying the wounded to the ship. Messengers
must be dispatched to Mr. Clark, with instructions
for him to forward all aboard the Reynard to aid us
on the way.”</p>

<p>Philip wasted no time in reply. He realized
fully how important it was that a more vigorous
defense should be made just at this moment, and he
urged the men to renewed exertions, if indeed that
was possible when every one battled for life itself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>

<p>Then began what has probably never had an
equal in warfare—the retreat of a large body of
armed men before a party of apes.</p>

<p>As Captain Seaworth had said, it required the
greater portion of his force to convey the wounded,
and so few remained to work the heavy guns, drawing
them back a few paces toward the sea-coast
after each discharge, that the commander himself
was forced to assist Philip.</p>

<p>It was fully a quarter of an hour before the last
wounded man left the building which had been converted
into a temporary hospital, and then, foot by
foot, the little party of artillerists literally fought
their way backward, while the rapid discharge of
fire-arms from those in advance told that the apes
had already circled around the retreating army.
As a cannon was discharged it would be drawn
twenty or thirty paces to the rear, the men reloading
even while it was moving, and the showers of
stones came thicker and more frequent.</p>

<p>Before half the necessary distance was traversed
Philip’s left shoulder had been so severely cut with
a fragment of rock as to render the arm useless,
while blood streamed down the captain’s face from
many minor wounds. Hardly a man among those
who were protecting the rear was uninjured, and
just when Philip began to fear that what had commenced
as an orderly march would end in a complete
rout, reinforcements from the ships arrived.</p>

<p>This party of thirty fresh men, each with a plentiful
supply of ammunition, checked the closely-pursuing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
apes, and it became possible to move the cannon
forty or fifty yards after each discharge.</p>

<p>Finally, to the intense relief of all, the beach was
gained, and here it was necessary to form in regular
line of battle while the wounded were being conveyed
to the ships in small boats.</p>

<p>It seemed as if the apes understood that this was
their last opportunity, for they immediately redoubled
their efforts. But now, however, being so
near a place of safety, the men fought even more
courageously than before, and huge sheets of flame
burst from the weapons as the missiles went hurtling
through the branches, causing great slaughter,
as could be told by the shrieks of the wounded and
dying animals.</p>

<p>Then the cannon were abandoned on the sea-shore
when the boats from both vessels were drawn up
ready to receive the defenders at the same moment,
and, still discharging their muskets rapidly, the
men were at last conveyed to a place of comparative
safety.</p>

<p>The deck of the Reynard looked not unlike that
of a line-of-battle ship after a terrific naval engagement.
Hammocks were slung in every direction;
improvised cots were placed fore and aft; and the
surgeon, with all the women, was fully occupied in
dressing the wounds until the sun once more sent
down his pitiless glare over the island and the sea.</p>

<p>Looking shoreward, along the road Philip had
caused to be made while he was king of the apes,
nothing could be seen of the picturesque little village<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
save a heap of blackened, smoking ruins. The
flames had done their work thoroughly, and not a
single building remained standing. That the scheme
of colonizing the island must be abandoned for the
time being, at least, Philip understood, since even if
Goliah and his forces could have been exterminated
immediately a return to the United States was
necessary in order to replenish the stores, as well as
to provide new buildings for the laborers.</p>

<p>When the wounded had been made as comfortable
as was possible under the circumstances, Philip
thought for the first time of the two chimpanzees,
and not seeing them anywhere around, he feared,
through some mischance, they had gone ashore
in one of the boats, in which case their doom was
certainly sealed.</p>

<p>In this, however, he was mistaken. Half an
hour later, while assisting the crew to rig up temporary
berths in the hold, he found the two animals
cowering in the forward portion of the ship, behind
some spare cables, and it was many moments before
he could induce either to come on deck.</p>

<p>Toward noon, when the intense heat rendered it
almost impossible for the crew to continue the work
of converting the ship into a temporary hospital,
Captain Seaworth held another consultation, and
this time it had no reference to how the apes might
be exterminated, but was simply a question of when
it would be possible to set sail.</p>

<p>There were yet a sufficient number of men to
work the ships as far as Batavia, unless they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
attacked by the pirates; and after deciding that it
would be better to run the chances of a fight at sea
than be caught at anchor by the Malays, Captain
Seaworth reported the fact of Philip’s having found
a vast amount of treasure in the subterranean chambers.</p>

<p>Never yet did blood outweigh gold, and every
member of the council was eager to become possessed
of the precious metal, even at the risk of another
encounter with the animals. There was but
little discussion necessary in order to arrive at the
opinion of the majority, which was that they
should defer sailing until at least one journey could
be made to the grotto, and a certain amount of the
wealth be brought away.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span></p>




<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXXVI">CHAPTER XXXVI.<br />
<span class="smaller">A DISAPPOINTMENT.</span></h2>

<p>Each hour increased the anxiety of Captain
Seaworth and his officers. There was every
reason to believe the pirates would return, and perhaps
very soon. It was not the custom of Malays
to acknowledge themselves vanquished so quickly,
and doubtless they had the fullest information concerning
the movements of the colonists from the
numberless small proas or sampans which can be
met in any direction under the guise of honest
traders.</p>

<p>Now that the colonists had returned, it was to be
expected the pirates would avenge themselves for
the injuries inflicted by the Reynard, and it was
more than probable these reprisals would be made
at the earliest possible moment. As Mr. Clark suggested:</p>

<p>“This time there will be no warning given. The
weapon we found serves to notify any of their
friends we may have with us to be on the alert, and
when the scoundrels come again it will be with the
utmost secrecy.”</p>

<p>The ship which brought the natives from Batavia
must also be taken back, and there were hardly
more than sufficient able-bodied men left after the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
battle to work both crafts into port. If, therefore,
the pirates should attack while the vessels were at
anchor, it would be possible to make only the slightest
show of defense. The Malays could easily finish
that which Goliah had begun, and the massacre
would be complete.</p>

<p>“Since we have decided to visit the cave,” Captain
Seaworth said, as the council of war was
brought to a close, “I believe it should be done
without loss of time. The apes have received such
a punishment as will probably prevent them from renewing
hostilities until after they have recovered
somewhat from the effects of the battle, and the
journey can be made more safely to-morrow morning
than twelve hours later.”</p>

<p>“You might also continue, captain, by saying
that it would be safer to go now than wait eighteen
hours,” Mr. Clark said.</p>

<p>Instead of replying, Captain Seaworth looked at
Philip questioningly, and the latter said, after a
brief time of thought:</p>

<p>“I am of the opinion that the attempt should be
made at once. We can return by sunset, and it will
then be possible to take advantage of the night-breeze
to get under way.”</p>

<p>There was no necessity for any further discussion,
and preparations for the journey were begun
without delay.</p>

<p>As a matter of course it was necessary to leave
behind as many of the able-bodied men as would be
sufficient to work the boats, because it was unsafe to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
moor the little crafts where the apes might destroy
or set them adrift, and after the crew had been told
off for this purpose there were but twenty-two uninjured
ones to go in search of the treasure.</p>

<p>Few as these were in number, they made a formidable
host because of their weapons. Each carried
a repeating-rifle, two revolvers, and a cutlass,
with ammunition enough to continue a spirited engagement
for at least an hour.</p>

<p>The afternoon was not more than half spent when
the little party was conveyed from the ship to the
shore, and, forming in a column of fours, marched
up the southern avenue to the ruins of the village,
each man on the alert for the slightest suspicious
sound which should betoken the coming of the
enemy.</p>

<p>During the march they took note of one singular
fact—the absence of any dead or wounded apes.</p>

<p>It was in this avenue that they had seen scores of
the enemy fall before the discharge of the cannon,
and it was not probable they had killed less than a
hundred. On the foliage were stains of blood, and
the broken surface of the road showed where the
soil had absorbed the life-blood of many a human
being as well as animal; but there were no other
traces of the fray. Several times did Captain Seaworth
and Philip leave the ranks to penetrate a
short distance among the underbrush, but without
gaining any information as to the disposition of the
dead.</p>

<p>On arriving at the ruins of the village it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
found deserted, like the avenue, and the treasure-seekers
continued on their way to the grotto.</p>

<p>This last portion of the journey was supposed to
be the most dangerous, and yet they reached the
mouth of the cavern without having been molested.</p>

<p>The work of carrying away the treasure which
had seemed so dangerous now appeared to be a very
simple task, and Philip, followed by his companions,
marched boldly into the grotto without a thought of
danger, when suddenly a shower of stones came from
the tunnel with such effect that three of the party
were stricken down.</p>

<p>Naturally the first thought of the men was to
return the fire; but on raising their weapons there
were no adversaries to be seen. As Philip and the
chimpanzees had barricaded the passage, so now had
Goliah, and a narrow slit at the top of the wall
through which the volley of stones had been sent
was the only aperture visible.</p>

<p>To aim at this opening would simply be a waste
of ammunition, since the bullets could only strike
the top of the tunnel, and this Philip understood in
a very few seconds.</p>

<p>There was no necessity, however, for him to
advise the beating of a retreat. Each man in turn,
on finding himself confronted by a shower of stones
when no enemy was visible, took refuge outside the
grotto, some of the more thoughtful carrying the
wounded with them; and here the gold-hunters took
counsel together.</p>

<p>“We can now understand why there were no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
wounded to be seen,” Captain Seaworth said. “The
big baboon has profited by Mr. Garland’s example
and fortified himself in this place, where he has most
likely set up a hospital. The question now is, Can
we dislodge him with the force at our command?”</p>

<p>“To that question I say, most emphatically, No,”
Philip replied. “The passage is so long, the amount
of rock in the chambers so great, that a thousand
men would hardly be sufficient to vanquish the apes
while they remain in a position which is almost
impregnable.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean that we cannot recover the treasure?”
Mr. Clark asked in surprise.</p>

<p>“You can answer that as well as I,” was Philip’s
reply. “The tunnel is not less than forty feet long,
and through it but two men can pass at a time. At
the further end we may safely say there are not less
than five hundred apes, who can procure plenty of
their peculiar ammunition by overturning the
stalactites; and from your experience in monkey
warfare do you fancy, now our party is reduced to
nineteen, that we can effect an entrance?”</p>

<p>“It may be that only a few of the baboon’s followers
have taken refuge here,” Mr. Clark suggested;
and the captain replied, quickly:</p>

<p>“There can be little doubt but that they are all
within the chamber, otherwise we should most certainly
have been attacked while coming up the road.
Mr. Garland has described the structure of this
place so well that we can fully understand the condition
of affairs, and I see no possible chance of recovering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
the treasure until the apes have retreated.”</p>

<p>“Which is the same as saying that we must abandon
all hope of getting it, since it would be hardly
less than madness to remain here in view of the fact
that the pirates may return at any moment,” Mr.
Clark added.</p>

<p>“Exactly so, gentlemen but at the same time I
leave it to you to say whether we shall go, or remain
in the faint hope of being able to dislodge the
baboon army.”</p>

<p>However eager the party might be to gain possession
of the vast treasure which they knew to be in
the cavern, all were forced to confess that under
present circumstances it was impossible to obtain it,
and with one accord the march to the sea was taken
up.</p>

<p>Already had the night-wind begun to blow. The
ships were rising and falling on the swelling sea,
tugging at their cables as if impatient to be away,
while far on the horizon toward the south could be
seen, by the naked eye, a tiny smudge of black
which betokened the coming of some craft, for no
land lay within the range of vision in that direction.</p>

<p>“Ahoy on the Reynard!” Captain Seaworth
shouted, and in the absence of any officer the surgeon
answered the hail.</p>

<p>“Have the lookouts reported a sail in the vicinity?”</p>

<p>“Ay, ay, sir. A fleet of proas coming from the
southward. Most likely the pirates whom we met
before.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span></p>

<p>This was sufficient to settle the question of treasure-seeking,
if that which had been seen at the
grotto was not convincing; and although Goliah had
wrought so much destruction, to him they were now
probably indebted for their lives, since, if it had
been possible to enter the subterranean chamber,
they would have remained several hours, in which
time the Malays could have approached so near as
to render flight impossible.</p>

<p>In less than thirty minutes both ships were under
way, every sail set and drawing, and before the
island of apes had faded in the distance the pirate
fleet was lost to view.</p>

<p>The scheme of colonizing the island was a failure.
It had cost the lives of many, the limbs of not a few,
and all the property brought from New York, while
absolutely nothing had been accomplished.</p>

<p>The port of Batavia was made without incident,
and, after only so long a stay as was necessary to
settle up certain business matters connected with the
corporation, the Reynard set sail for the home port.</p>

<p>To-day Philip Garland is in New York, and with
him are the two chimpanzees; but whether he ever
returns to the island, of which he was once king, in
search of the vast treasure known to be there, is a
question he only can answer, and at the present
time he has not decided.</p>

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed

  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
